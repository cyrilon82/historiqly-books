## How to add a Description

1. Go to **Bookshelf > your book > Book Details > Description**
2. Click the **Source** button (top-right of the text editor)
3. Paste the raw HTML (with `<p>`, `<b>`, `<i>` tags)
4. Click **Source** again to preview the formatted version
5. Must be under **4,000 characters**

### Description style guide

- Open with a hook — one dramatic sentence that sets the scene
- Short punchy paragraph for the twist or stakes
- "This is the full story — ..." bridge paragraph
- "Inside this investigation:" section with bullet-style `<p>` lines
- Close with the HistorIQly boilerplate:
  - `HistorIQly is narrative non-fiction. No speculation. No sensationalism. Just the evidence, told as a story.`
  - `Part of the HistorIQly: [Series Name] series.`

## How to add Keywords

1. Go to **Bookshelf > your book > Book Details > Keywords**
2. Fill in up to **7 keyword boxes** (one phrase per box)

### Keyword rules

- Don't repeat words already in your title or subtitle (Amazon indexes those automatically)
- No commas within a single box — each box is one phrase
- No quotes, just plain text
- Mix broad terms (e.g. "narrative nonfiction history") with specific ones (e.g. "königsberg castle mystery")
- Think about what a buyer would actually type into Amazon search
