      title: 'The Storm',
      content: `<p>The storm came from the north. It came in November, when the Aegean turns from blue to grey and the wind off the Peloponnese has teeth in it, and it caught a fleet of small boats in the strait between Crete and the island of Kythera. The year was 1900. The boats were crewed by sponge divers from the island of Symi, near Rhodes — hard, lean men who made their living pulling natural sponges from the seabed and who, by the nature of their trade, understood the sea better than most sailors and feared it more than most soldiers.</p>
<p>Their captain was Dimitrios Kondos. He was experienced, cautious, and not inclined to risk his crew in bad weather. When the storm forced them to shelter in the lee of a small, barren island called Antikythera — a rocky comma of land halfway between Crete and the Greek mainland — he decided to wait it out. And while they waited, he decided to put the time to use. The waters around Antikythera were deep, but not impossibly deep. There might be sponges.</p>
<p>He sent a diver down. The man's name was Elias Stadiatis. He was wearing the standard equipment of a Greek sponge diver at the turn of the century: a canvas suit sealed at the wrists and neck, a copper helmet with a glass faceplate, lead-soled boots, and an air hose connected to a hand-cranked pump on the surface. The suit was clumsy, the visibility was poor, and the depth — roughly sixty metres — was dangerous. Nitrogen narcosis was a constant risk. Sponge divers died regularly, and those who survived often suffered from decompression sickness that left them bent and crippled.</p>
<p>Stadiatis descended into the gloom. The water was cold and dark. He landed on a rocky shelf and began to search for sponges, moving slowly along the bottom in the ponderous, dreamlike gait that the diving suit imposed. And then he saw something that made him forget about sponges entirely.</p>
<p>The seabed was strewn with bodies. Dozens of them. Arms, legs, torsos, faces — scattered across the rocks like the aftermath of a massacre. In the dim greenish light, with nitrogen already fizzing in his blood, Stadiatis saw what appeared to be a field of the dead.</p>
<p>He signalled to be hauled up. He broke the surface gasping and incoherent, babbling about corpses and horses and naked women on the seabed. Kondos thought the diver had lost his mind — narcosis did that to men sometimes, filling their brains with hallucinations. But Stadiatis was insistent. He had seen what he had seen.</p>
<p>Kondos pulled on a suit and went down himself. What he found was not a field of corpses. It was something far more extraordinary. The bodies were statues — bronze and marble figures of astonishing quality, scattered across the seafloor amid the remains of a large ancient ship. There were bronze arms and legs, a life-sized bronze head, marble torsos worn smooth by two thousand years of salt water. There was pottery. There was glassware. There was a heap of corroded metal objects that nobody, at that moment, paid any attention to.</p>
<p>Kondos knew immediately what he had found. Not just a wreck, but a treasure ship — a Roman vessel, loaded with Greek art and luxury goods, that had gone down in this strait sometime in the first century before Christ. He surfaced, gathered his crew, and made a decision that would change the history of archaeology.</p>
<p>He reported the find to the Greek government.</p>
<p>This was not the obvious move. Kondos was a sponge diver, not an archaeologist. The statues were worth a fortune on the black market. He could have quietly stripped the wreck, sold the artefacts through middlemen, and retired wealthy. Other men in his position had done exactly that. But Kondos was either unusually patriotic or unusually far-sighted — or perhaps he simply calculated that the Greek government would reward him more generously than a fence in Alexandria — and he sailed to Athens with a bronze arm as proof of his discovery.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities were electrified. The country was poor, recently independent, and desperate for anything that connected it to its glorious classical past. A shipwreck full of ancient Greek art was a national treasure, and the government moved with uncharacteristic speed. Within weeks, they had commissioned Kondos and his divers to conduct a full salvage operation, under the supervision of archaeologists from the National Museum in Athens.</p>
<p>The work began in November 1900 and continued, intermittently, through the following year. It was brutal. The divers worked at depths of fifty to sixty metres, in cold water and strong currents, using nothing more sophisticated than their diving suits and their hands. They hauled statues, amphorae, jewellery, coins, and corroded lumps of indeterminate material up from the seabed, basket by basket. One diver was killed. Two others were permanently paralysed by decompression sickness.</p>
<p>Among the objects they brought to the surface — catalogued, crated, and shipped to the National Archaeological Museum in Athens — was a lump of corroded bronze about the size of a large book. It was encrusted with calcium deposits and green with verdigris, and it looked like nothing in particular. It was tagged, stored, and forgotten.</p>
<p>For two years, nobody looked at it twice.</p>`,

      title: 'The Lump',
      content: `<p>The National Archaeological Museum in Athens was overwhelmed. The Antikythera shipwreck had yielded one of the largest hauls of ancient art ever recovered from the sea, and the museum's small staff of archaeologists and conservators was struggling to catalogue and preserve everything. The statues were the priority — the magnificent bronze Youth, the marble Hercules, the glass bowls and gold jewellery — and the less glamorous material was set aside for later examination.</p>
<p>The corroded bronze lump sat in a wooden tray in the museum's storeroom for months. Nobody knew what it was. It weighed about a kilogram, measured roughly thirty-four centimetres by eighteen centimetres by nine centimetres, and appeared to be a single mass of fused metal and mineral deposits. It looked like a rock with pretensions.</p>
<p>Then, on 17 May 1902, a Greek archaeologist named Valerios Stais was sorting through the Antikythera material when he noticed something that made him stop. The corroded lump had split — either from drying out in the museum air or from the gentle handling of conservators — and inside the crack, visible through the encrustation, was something impossible. A gear. A small, precisely cut toothed wheel, made of bronze, embedded in the corroded mass like a secret.</p>
<p>Stais looked closer. There were more gears. Through the gaps in the corrosion, he could see the edges of multiple interlocking toothed wheels, layered on top of one another in a compact assembly that was clearly mechanical. This was not a random lump of corroded metal. This was a machine.</p>
<p>Stais announced his finding. He proposed that the object was some kind of astronomical calculating device — an ancient instrument for predicting the positions of celestial bodies. The idea was met with polite disbelief, then active dismissal, then something close to contempt. The scholarly consensus was swift and emphatic: the ancient Greeks did not build gear mechanisms. The object must be a later addition to the wreck — a medieval astrolabe, perhaps, that had fallen onto the site from a more recent shipwreck. Or it was a navigation instrument from the Ottoman period. Or it was simply being misidentified.</p>
<p>The problem was not the evidence. The problem was the implication. If this object was genuinely from the same period as the rest of the Antikythera cargo — roughly the first century BCE — then it represented a level of mechanical sophistication that the ancient world was not supposed to possess. Gears of this precision, arranged in this complexity, implied a tradition of mechanical engineering that had no place in the accepted history of technology. It was easier, and far more comfortable, to assume that Stais was wrong.</p>
<p>Most scholars assumed exactly that. The object was noted in the archaeological literature, described briefly, and filed away. For the next half-century, it sat in the National Museum, a curiosity in a glass case, visited occasionally by tourists who glanced at the corroded fragments without understanding what they were looking at. The label on the case said something vague about an ancient instrument. Nobody could say more, because nobody had studied it.</p>
<p>The statues, meanwhile, became famous. The Antikythera Youth — a magnificent bronze figure of a young man, possibly Paris or Perseus — was celebrated as one of the finest surviving examples of ancient Greek sculpture. It became the face of the Antikythera shipwreck. The corroded lump of gears became a footnote.</p>
<p>There were a few exceptions. In the 1900s and 1910s, a German philologist named Albert Rehm examined the fragments and identified traces of Greek inscriptions on the surface. He recognised astronomical terms and numbers. He suspected that the device was a kind of mechanical calendar, and he published his observations in academic journals. Nobody paid much attention. Rehm was a philologist, not an engineer, and his tentative conclusions lacked the authority to overturn the prevailing assumption that the object was either anomalous or misidentified.</p>
<p>The two world wars intervened. Greece was occupied, the museum was closed, and the Antikythera fragments sat in their case through decades of upheaval. The scholarly world had other priorities. By the time the dust settled, the mechanism had been in the museum for over fifty years, and the number of people who had seriously studied it could be counted on one hand.</p>
<p>It was waiting for someone who would look at it without assumptions. Someone who would see the gears not as an impossibility but as a question. Someone who would ask, not "How can this exist?" but "What does it do?"</p>
<p>That person arrived in 1951. His name was Derek de Solla Price, and he was about to become obsessed.</p>`,

      title: 'Gears from the Greeks',
      content: `<p>Derek John de Solla Price was born in Leyton, East London, in 1922. His father was a tailor. His mother was a singer. Neither background suggested a career in the history of science, but Price had the kind of mind that refused to stay in its lane — restless, omnivorous, and constitutionally incapable of accepting conventional wisdom without testing it first.</p>
<p>He trained as a physicist at the University of London, worked briefly in the applied sciences, and then pivoted into the history and philosophy of science — a field that allowed him to combine his technical training with a deep curiosity about how ideas develop, how technologies emerge, and how civilisations build on the work of their predecessors. By the early 1950s, he was at Cambridge, working on a history of scientific instruments, and it was there that he first encountered the Antikythera mechanism.</p>
<p>He did not see it in person at first. He read about it in a journal article — one of the sparse, half-forgotten references that had accumulated over the decades — and something in the description stopped him. A gear mechanism from a first-century BCE shipwreck. Multiple interlocking bronze wheels. Traces of astronomical inscriptions. The scholarly consensus that it was probably medieval.</p>
<p>Price did not accept the consensus. He could not accept it, because he knew something that most classical scholars did not: that ancient texts contained references to mechanical devices of remarkable sophistication. Cicero, writing in the first century BCE, described a device built by Archimedes that modelled the motions of the sun, moon, and planets. The Roman engineer Vitruvius described complex gear trains used in water clocks and odometers. The evidence for ancient mechanical engineering was there, scattered across the literary record, but nobody had connected it to the physical evidence in the museum in Athens.</p>
<p>Price went to Athens. He examined the fragments. He photographed them, measured them, and began the painstaking work of analysing the gear teeth — counting them, calculating their ratios, trying to understand what the mechanism was designed to compute. It was difficult work. The corrosion was severe. Many of the gears were fused together or broken. The inscriptions were barely legible. But Price could see enough to know that this was not a medieval astrolabe. It was something else entirely. Something older, more complex, and more significant than anyone had imagined.</p>
<p>In 1959, Price published a preliminary paper in <em>Scientific American</em> titled "An Ancient Greek Computer." The title alone was a provocation. The word "computer" was deliberate — Price meant to draw a parallel between the Antikythera mechanism and the electronic calculating machines that were just beginning to transform the modern world. The mechanism, he argued, was an analog computer: a device that used mechanical gears to model mathematical relationships and produce calculated outputs. It was, in essence, a machine for predicting the future positions of celestial bodies.</p>
<p>The paper caused a sensation. It was the first time the Antikythera mechanism had been presented to a general audience, and the reaction was a mixture of fascination and scepticism. An ancient Greek computer? The idea seemed fantastical, the stuff of science fiction rather than sober scholarship. Many classicists were dubious. Many historians of technology were outright hostile. The ancient Greeks were philosophers and artists, not engineers. They built temples and wrote tragedies. They did not build computers.</p>
<p>Price ignored the sceptics and pressed on. He arranged for the fragments to be X-rayed — a revolutionary approach at the time — using a portable X-ray unit brought to the museum. The X-rays were a revelation. They penetrated the corrosion and revealed the internal structure of the mechanism in ghostly, overlapping shadows. Price could see gear wheels that were invisible to the naked eye. He could count teeth. He could trace the outlines of components that had been hidden inside the corroded mass for two millennia.</p>
<p>The X-rays confirmed Price's suspicion: the mechanism contained at least thirty gears, arranged in a complex train of interlocking wheels that transmitted motion from a single input — a hand-cranked knob on the side — to multiple output dials on the front and back of the device. The gear ratios were not arbitrary. They encoded specific astronomical cycles. The mechanism was, as Price had claimed, a calculating machine.</p>
<p>In 1974, Price published his definitive study: <em>Gears from the Greeks</em>. It was a landmark work — the first comprehensive analysis of the Antikythera mechanism, based on years of examination, X-ray analysis, and mathematical reconstruction. Price identified the main gear train and showed that it was designed to reproduce the motion of the sun and moon through the zodiac. He identified the Metonic cycle — the nineteen-year period after which the phases of the moon repeat on the same dates — as one of the key astronomical relationships encoded in the gears.</p>
<p>The book established the Antikythera mechanism as a genuine artefact of ancient Greek technology. It did not solve all the mysteries — Price's analysis contained errors, and his reconstruction of the mechanism was incomplete — but it transformed the corroded lump in the Athens museum from a curiosity into one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Price died in 1983, at the age of sixty-one. He did not live to see the full revelation of what the mechanism contained. That would take another generation of researchers, and a technology that did not yet exist.</p>`,

      title: 'The Machine',
      content: `<p>What, exactly, was the Antikythera mechanism? The question sounds simple. The answer is not.</p>
<p>Begin with the physical object. The mechanism was housed in a wooden case roughly the size of a large shoebox — about thirty-four centimetres tall, eighteen centimetres wide, and nine centimetres deep. The case has not survived; only the bronze components remain. Those components consist of at least thirty-seven gear wheels — some researchers believe there were originally more — made of sheet bronze about two millimetres thick, with teeth cut to a triangular profile by hand. The largest gear, known as the main drive wheel, is approximately fourteen centimetres in diameter and has 223 teeth.</p>
<p>Two hundred and twenty-three. That number is not arbitrary. It is the number of lunar months in a Saros cycle — the period of approximately eighteen years after which eclipses of the sun and moon repeat in nearly the same pattern. The fact that this number was cut, tooth by tooth, into a bronze wheel two thousand years ago tells you something about both the astronomical knowledge and the mechanical skill of whoever built this device.</p>
<p>The mechanism had dials on both its front and back faces. The front dial displayed the positions of the sun and moon against the zodiac — the twelve constellations that form a band across the sky through which the sun, moon, and planets appear to move. A pointer for the sun moved smoothly around the dial, completing one revolution per year. A pointer for the moon moved at a different rate, completing its circuit in a lunar month. The moon pointer also reproduced the moon's anomalous motion — the fact that the moon moves faster at some points in its orbit than at others — through an ingenious mechanism involving a pin-and-slot device that converted uniform circular motion into variable motion.</p>
<p>This is worth pausing on. The moon's orbit is not a perfect circle. It is an ellipse, and the moon moves faster when it is closer to the earth and slower when it is farther away. This variation — known to ancient astronomers and described mathematically by the astronomer Hipparchus in the second century BCE — is not easy to model mechanically. The Antikythera mechanism did it with a pair of gears connected by an offset pin and slot, which produced exactly the right variation in speed. It was a mechanical solution to an astronomical problem, and it was breathtakingly elegant.</p>
<p>The back of the mechanism had two large spiral dials. The upper spiral was a Metonic dial — a calendar that tracked the 235 lunar months in a nineteen-year Metonic cycle, allowing the user to reconcile the solar year with the lunar calendar. Nested inside this spiral was a smaller dial that displayed the four-year cycle of the Panhellenic games: the Olympics, the Pythian Games at Delphi, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games at Corinth.</p>
<p>The lower spiral on the back was a Saros dial — a predictor of solar and lunar eclipses. This dial tracked the 223-month Saros cycle and indicated, for each month, whether an eclipse was predicted. Small glyphs inscribed on the dial specified the type of eclipse (solar or lunar), the time of day, and the direction. A subsidiary dial tracked the Exeligmos cycle — three Saros cycles, or fifty-four years — to refine the eclipse predictions further.</p>
<p>And there was more. The front dial almost certainly displayed the positions of the five planets known to the ancient world: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The evidence for planetary gearing is indirect — most of the relevant components have been lost — but the inscriptions on the mechanism refer to planetary motions, and researchers have reconstructed plausible gear trains that would reproduce the apparent motions of the planets as seen from Earth, including their retrograde loops.</p>
<p>To operate the mechanism, the user turned a hand crank on the side. This rotated the main drive wheel, which transmitted motion through the gear train to all the output dials simultaneously. Turning the crank forward advanced the date; turning it backward moved the date in reverse. At any setting, the user could read the position of the sun and moon in the zodiac, the phase of the moon, the current date in both the solar and lunar calendars, the timing of upcoming eclipses, the positions of the planets, and the schedule of the athletic games.</p>
<p>It was, in short, a portable model of the cosmos. A hand-held universe. You could carry it in a satchel, set it on a table, turn a handle, and watch the heavens move.</p>
<p>Nothing like it would be built again for more than a thousand years.</p>`,

      title: 'Fragment A',
      content: `<p>For all that Derek de Solla Price had achieved, his analysis was limited by the technology available to him. The X-rays he used in the 1970s produced flat, two-dimensional images — useful for seeing through the corrosion, but unable to distinguish overlapping gears or read inscriptions that were buried beneath layers of mineral deposits. Many of the mechanism's secrets remained locked inside its corroded fragments.</p>
<p>The fragments themselves were a problem. The mechanism had not survived as a single object. It had broken apart, probably during the shipwreck or during the two thousand years it spent on the seafloor, into eighty-two separate pieces. The largest, designated Fragment A, contained the main drive gear and much of the front gear train. Fragment B contained part of the back dial system. Fragment C contained the front dial plate with the zodiac scale. Fragments D through G were smaller, less well-preserved pieces. The remaining seventy-five fragments were tiny — some no bigger than a fingernail — and their relationship to the larger pieces was unclear.</p>
<p>Fragment A was the key. It was the largest surviving piece, roughly eighteen centimetres across, and it contained the heart of the mechanism: the main drive gear with its 223 teeth, several of the intermediate gears, and traces of inscriptions on its surface. If the mechanism could be fully understood, it would be understood through Fragment A.</p>
<p>But understanding Fragment A required seeing inside it in three dimensions, at a resolution fine enough to read individual gear teeth and inscribed letters. In the 1970s, this was impossible. By the early 2000s, it was not.</p>
<p>In 2005, an international team of researchers called the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project — led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth of Cardiff University, in collaboration with the National Archaeological Museum in Athens — brought two extraordinary pieces of technology to bear on the fragments. The first was a surface imaging system developed by Hewlett-Packard, which used a technique called polynomial texture mapping to photograph the surfaces of the fragments under dozens of different lighting angles and combine the results into a single, ultra-high-resolution image that revealed details invisible to the naked eye. The inscriptions, in particular, leapt out of the corroded bronze with startling clarity.</p>
<p>The second was a computed tomography scanner — a CT scanner — but not the kind used in hospitals. This was a custom-built machine, designed by a company called X-Tek (later acquired by Nikon), specifically for imaging dense, heavily corroded archaeological objects. The machine weighed eight tonnes and had to be shipped from England to Athens in a specially chartered truck. It could penetrate the bronze and calcium deposits that encased the mechanism's gears and produce three-dimensional images of the internal structure at a resolution of fifty microns — fine enough to count individual gear teeth and read letters less than two millimetres tall.</p>
<p>The results were staggering. The CT scans revealed gear wheels that Price had never seen. They showed the pin-and-slot mechanism that modelled the moon's variable speed — a device of extraordinary mechanical ingenuity that Price had not been able to identify from his flat X-rays. They revealed that the main drive gear had exactly 223 teeth, confirming its connection to the Saros eclipse cycle. They showed the subsidiary dials, the spiral scales, and the complex arrangement of concentric tubes that carried the pointers on the front dial.</p>
<p>But the most dramatic revelation was the inscriptions. The surface imaging and CT scans together revealed over three thousand characters of Greek text inscribed on the mechanism's surfaces — far more than anyone had suspected. The text included astronomical instructions, descriptions of what each dial displayed, references to the colours of eclipses, and the names of months in a calendar used in the cities of Corinth and its colonies. The text was tiny — some characters were barely 1.2 millimetres tall — and it had been engraved with a precision that implied the use of magnifying tools or exceptional eyesight.</p>
<p>The inscriptions were a user manual. They told the owner how to operate the mechanism, what each display meant, and how to interpret the astronomical data it produced. They transformed the Antikythera mechanism from a mysterious object into an intelligible instrument — a device whose purpose and function could, for the first time, be fully understood.</p>
<p>Tony Freeth, who had come to the project as a mathematician and filmmaker, became its most passionate advocate. He published paper after paper, each one revealing new details, new gear trains, new functions. The mechanism, he showed, was far more sophisticated than Price had imagined. It was not just a calendar or an eclipse predictor. It was a comprehensive model of the Greek cosmos — a mechanical embodiment of the astronomical knowledge accumulated over centuries by the greatest minds of the ancient world.</p>
<p>In 2021, Freeth and a team at University College London published a paper in <em>Scientific Reports</em> proposing a complete reconstruction of the mechanism's front dial, including the planetary displays. The reconstruction required a level of mechanical complexity that pushed the boundaries of what scholars had thought possible for ancient technology. It was audacious, contested, and brilliant.</p>
<p>The Antikythera mechanism was finally giving up its secrets. But the biggest question remained: Who built it?</p>`,

      title: 'The Cosmos in Bronze',
      content: `<p>The inscriptions told stories. Not just instructions — stories about the cosmos as the Greeks understood it, embedded in tiny letters on corroded bronze.</p>
<p>The front dial of the mechanism displayed the zodiac — the twelve constellations through which the sun appears to move over the course of a year. But it also displayed an Egyptian calendar of 365 days, concentric with the zodiac ring, which could be adjusted to account for the fact that the solar year is not exactly 365 days. The mechanism's designers knew about this discrepancy. They built in a correction.</p>
<p>The pointer for the sun moved at a uniform rate — one revolution per year — but the zodiac ring was not uniformly divided. The spaces allocated to each constellation varied slightly, reflecting the fact that the sun appears to move faster through some parts of the zodiac than others. This is a consequence of the Earth's elliptical orbit, though the Greeks did not know about elliptical orbits. What they knew was the observational fact: the sun spends more time in some constellations than in others. The mechanism reproduced this variation mechanically.</p>
<p>The moon pointer was more complex. It moved at the moon's average rate — one revolution every 27.3 days — but its actual speed varied, thanks to the pin-and-slot mechanism that modelled the moon's orbital anomaly. The same system also displayed the moon's phase, using a half-black, half-white ball that rotated inside a small aperture on the front dial. As the mechanism was cranked forward, the ball turned, showing the progression from new moon to full moon and back — a miniature mechanical recreation of the lunar cycle that anyone could understand at a glance.</p>
<p>The back dials were where the real astronomical sophistication lay. The Metonic dial was a masterpiece of compact design. The nineteen-year Metonic cycle — named after the Athenian astronomer Meton, who described it in 432 BCE — contains exactly 235 lunar months. The dial was laid out as a five-turn spiral, each turn representing 47 months, for a total of 235. A pointer driven by the gear train tracked the current position in the cycle, allowing the user to convert between the solar calendar and the lunar calendar with precision.</p>
<p>Nested inside the Metonic dial was the Games dial — a smaller, subsidiary display that tracked the four-year cycle of the Panhellenic athletic festivals. The inscriptions on this dial named specific games: the Olympics at Olympia, the Pythian Games at Delphi, the Nemean Games at Nemea, the Isthmian Games at Corinth, and — intriguingly — the Naa Games at Dodona and the Halieia at Rhodes. The inclusion of the Halieia was significant. It was a festival specific to Rhodes, and its presence on the mechanism was one of several clues pointing to Rhodes as the place of manufacture.</p>
<p>The lower spiral on the back was the Saros dial, which tracked the 223-month eclipse cycle. Each cell of the spiral corresponded to one lunar month, and where an eclipse was predicted, a small glyph was inscribed. The glyphs were dense with information: they indicated whether the eclipse was solar or lunar, gave the time of day (to the nearest hour), and specified a directional index. The Exeligmos subsidiary dial refined these predictions by tracking the three-Saros super-cycle of fifty-four years.</p>
<p>The eclipse predictions were not original calculations. They were based on Babylonian eclipse records that had been accumulated over centuries of systematic observation in Mesopotamia and transmitted to the Greek world. The mechanism's designers took these records — tables of dates and times, painstakingly compiled by Babylonian astronomers — and encoded them into a mechanical system that could reproduce the predictions automatically. It was a fusion of Babylonian observational astronomy and Greek mechanical engineering, and it represented the highest achievement of both traditions.</p>
<p>The inscriptions also contained something unexpected: references to the colours of eclipses. One fragment described eclipses in terms of colour — dark, fiery, or reddish — information that had no obvious astronomical function but that connected the mechanism to a tradition of eclipse omens and portents. The Greeks, for all their astronomical sophistication, had not entirely separated science from superstition. The mechanism was a calculating device, but it existed in a world where eclipses were still signs from the gods.</p>
<p>What emerged from the inscriptions was a picture of a device that was both more sophisticated and more human than anyone had expected. It was not a cold, abstract calculating machine. It was a tool for understanding the cosmos as the Greeks experienced it — a cosmos where the movements of the heavens governed the calendar, the festivals, the planting of crops, and the will of the gods. The mechanism brought all of this together in a single, portable, hand-cranked instrument that anyone with the skill to read its dials could operate.</p>
<p>It was, in the deepest sense, a worldview made physical. A philosophy cast in bronze.</p>`,

      title: 'The Maker',
      content: `<p>Who built it? This is the question that haunts the Antikythera mechanism — the question that every scholar who has studied it has tried to answer, and that none has answered with certainty.</p>
<p>The shipwreck provides some constraints. The cargo ship went down sometime between 70 and 60 BCE, based on the coins, pottery, and other datable objects found at the site. The ship was travelling from the eastern Mediterranean toward Italy — probably Rome — carrying a cargo of Greek art, luxury goods, and other valuable items. It was the kind of vessel that served the Roman appetite for Greek culture: a supply ship for the empire's insatiable collectors.</p>
<p>But the mechanism itself is older than the shipwreck. The astronomical data encoded in its gears — particularly the eclipse predictions on the Saros dial — correspond to a start date around 205 BCE. The style of the inscriptions, the letter forms, and the calendar system all point to a date of manufacture in the second half of the second century BCE, perhaps around 150 to 100 BCE. The mechanism was already an antique when the ship went down.</p>
<p>The calendar inscriptions provide the strongest geographical clue. The month names on the Metonic dial are from the Corinthian calendar — a system used in Corinth and its colonies, including Syracuse in Sicily. The presence of the Halieia festival on the Games dial points specifically to Rhodes. And Rhodes, in the second and first centuries BCE, was the intellectual capital of the Greek world — a centre of astronomy, philosophy, and mechanical engineering that attracted scholars from across the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Two names dominate the speculation: Hipparchus and Posidonius.</p>
<p>Hipparchus of Nicaea was the greatest astronomer of the ancient world. Working primarily on Rhodes in the second century BCE, he compiled the first comprehensive star catalogue, discovered the precession of the equinoxes, and developed the mathematical models of solar and lunar motion that the Antikythera mechanism appears to encode. The lunar anomaly mechanism — the pin-and-slot device that reproduces the moon's variable speed — is based directly on Hipparchus's lunar theory. If anyone in the ancient world had the astronomical knowledge to design the Antikythera mechanism, it was Hipparchus.</p>
<p>But Hipparchus was an astronomer, not an engineer. There is no evidence that he built mechanical devices. The man most often associated with the actual construction of such instruments was Posidonius of Apamea, a philosopher, scientist, and polymath who established a school on Rhodes in the first century BCE. Cicero visited Posidonius on Rhodes and described seeing a mechanical planetarium — an orrery — that modelled the motions of the sun, moon, and planets. Cicero's description matches the known functions of the Antikythera mechanism with remarkable precision.</p>
<p>Was the mechanism built by Posidonius? Or by a student of Posidonius? Or by an earlier craftsman working in the tradition of Hipparchus? There is no definitive answer. The mechanism bears no maker's mark. The inscriptions do not name an author. The device exists as a masterpiece without a signature.</p>
<p>There is also the shadow of Archimedes. The greatest engineer of the ancient world, Archimedes of Syracuse was famous for his mechanical inventions, and Cicero specifically describes seeing an Archimedean orrery — a device that showed the movements of the sun, moon, and planets — that was captured during the sack of Syracuse in 212 BCE. The Corinthian calendar on the Antikythera mechanism connects it to Syracuse, Archimedes' home city. Some researchers have suggested that the mechanism represents a tradition of mechanical astronomy that originated with Archimedes and was continued by his intellectual descendants for generations.</p>
<p>This is speculation, but it is not wild speculation. The ancient literary sources consistently describe mechanical planetaria as real, functioning devices. Cicero mentions them repeatedly. Ovid refers to them. Pappus of Alexandria, writing in the fourth century CE, describes Archimedes as having written a treatise on the construction of such instruments — a treatise that has been lost. The Antikythera mechanism may be the sole surviving example of a tradition that was once widespread.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then the question "Who built it?" may be the wrong question. The right question may be: How many were there? How many devices like this were built, used, and eventually lost? How much ancient mechanical knowledge has been destroyed, melted down, or corroded beyond recognition on the floors of ancient seas?</p>
<p>The Antikythera mechanism survives by accident — a chance shipwreck, a chance discovery by sponge divers, a chance crack in the corrosion that revealed a gear. If any one of those accidents had not occurred, we would not know that such a device had ever existed. And that thought — the thought of what else might have existed and been lost — is perhaps the most unsettling thing about the Antikythera mechanism.</p>
<p>It is not the mechanism itself that challenges our understanding of the ancient world. It is the implication that the mechanism was not unique.</p>`,

      content: `<p>The Antikythera mechanism sits today in a climate-controlled case in Room 38 of the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. The fragments are arranged on white mounts under glass — Fragment A in the centre, with its great drive gear and its clusters of smaller wheels visible through the encrustation; Fragment B to one side, with its dial plates and spiral tracks; Fragment C with its zodiac scale and calendar ring. The smaller fragments are grouped nearby, some no larger than a postage stamp, each one meticulously labelled and photographed.</p>
<p>It does not look like much. Visitors who have come to see the bronze Youth or the gold of Mycenae often walk past the mechanism without stopping. It is brown and green and encrusted, and it does not photograph well, and it requires an act of imagination to see it as what it was: a device of extraordinary precision, built by hands that understood both the mathematics of the heavens and the mechanics of bronze, in a civilisation that we thought we understood but clearly did not.</p>
<p>The gap is what disturbs. Not the mechanism itself — which is, after all, a machine, comprehensible once you know how it works — but the gap between the mechanism and everything that came after it. After the Antikythera mechanism, nothing of comparable sophistication appears in the archaeological record for more than a thousand years. The next known gear mechanisms of any complexity are Islamic astronomical instruments from the medieval period — devices that are impressive in their own right but that do not approach the Antikythera mechanism's integration of multiple astronomical functions in a single, compact device.</p>
<p>How does a technology this advanced simply disappear?</p>
<p>The answer, insofar as there is one, lies in the nature of ancient knowledge transmission. The Antikythera mechanism was not a mass-produced consumer product. It was a bespoke instrument, built by a specialist craftsman — or a small workshop of craftsmen — using techniques that required years of training and deep astronomical knowledge. The skills needed to build it were probably held by a very small number of people, passed from master to apprentice in an unbroken chain.</p>
<p>Chains break. Wars destroy workshops. Plagues kill craftsmen. Political upheavals scatter communities of knowledge. The Roman conquest of Greece in the second and first centuries BCE disrupted the intellectual centres where such devices were made. The sack of Corinth in 146 BCE destroyed one of the wealthiest cities in the Greek world. The Roman civil wars of the first century BCE destabilised the eastern Mediterranean. And the gradual shift from Greek to Roman cultural dominance brought a change in priorities: the Romans valued engineering for practical purposes — roads, aqueducts, siege weapons — but showed less interest in the kind of abstract astronomical modelling that the mechanism represented.</p>
<p>The knowledge did not vanish overnight. Fragments survived in texts — Cicero's descriptions, Vitruvius's references to gear mechanisms, Pappus's account of Archimedes' writings. Arabic scholars preserved and translated some of these texts during the Islamic Golden Age, and it is through the Arabic tradition that geared astronomical instruments eventually re-emerged in the medieval period. But the specific, detailed, hands-on knowledge of how to build a device like the Antikythera mechanism — the craft knowledge, the workshop traditions, the accumulated tricks and refinements — was lost.</p>
<p>This is the real lesson of the Antikythera mechanism. Not that the ancient Greeks were cleverer than we thought, though they were. Not that ancient technology was more advanced than we assumed, though it was. The real lesson is about the fragility of knowledge. About how easily the accumulated achievements of centuries can be lost — not through some dramatic catastrophe, but through the slow, undramatic process of forgetting. Through the death of the last craftsman who knew how. Through the burning of the last scroll that explained why. Through the quiet, unremarkable moment when the chain of transmission breaks and nobody notices until it is too late to repair.</p>
<p>The Antikythera mechanism survived by pure chance. A ship sank. Sponge divers found it. A crack in the corrosion revealed a gear. A physicist became obsessed. An engineer built a scanner. Piece by piece, over more than a century, the mechanism yielded its secrets to people who were patient enough to listen.</p>
<p>But for every mechanism that survives, how many are lost? For every technology that is rediscovered, how many are forgotten forever? The Antikythera mechanism is not just a wonder. It is a warning. It tells us that the past was richer and more sophisticated than our surviving records suggest. It tells us that the line between knowledge and ignorance is thinner than we think. And it tells us that the most dangerous assumption we can make about the past is that we know what was possible.</p>
<p>We do not. The gears in Room 38 prove that we do not.</p>
<p>They sit in their case, bronze and broken, silent and precise, and they ask the question that has haunted every researcher who has spent time with them, from Valerios Stais to Tony Freeth: <em>What else have we lost?</em></p>`,
