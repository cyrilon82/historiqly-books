      title: 'The Invention of Arrr',
      content: `<p>On a November afternoon in 1950, a Cornish actor named Robert Newton walked onto a soundstage at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, and invented a language.</p>
<p>Newton had been cast as Long John Silver in Disney's first fully live-action feature film, <em>Treasure Island</em>. The role called for a pirate — the pirate, the definitive rogue of the high seas — and Newton, who had grown up in Dorset on England's southwest coast, decided to play him in the accent of his childhood. He rolled his Rs like a man gargling gravel. He stretched his vowels into shapes that no English-speaking human had ever produced on screen. He growled, he rumbled, he leered, and every third word seemed to be some variation of <em>arrr</em>.</p>
<p>The film was a hit. Newton's performance was a sensation. And the pirate accent — that unmistakable, over-the-top West Country growl — became, overnight, the way pirates talked. Not just in movies. In books, in cartoons, in theme parks, in Halloween costumes, in the collective imagination of the English-speaking world. When you hear a pirate voice in your head, you are hearing Robert Newton.</p>
<p>The problem is that real pirates never talked like that.</p>
<p>There is no historical record of any pirate in the Golden Age of Piracy — roughly 1650 to 1730 — speaking in the rolling, theatrical West Country accent that Newton invented. Pirates came from every part of the British Isles, from the Netherlands, from France, from West Africa, from the American colonies, from the indigenous Caribbean. They spoke in the accents of Bristol and London and Boston and Kingston and Accra. They spoke English and French and Spanish and Dutch and Creole and pidgin and African languages whose names were never recorded by the European authorities who hanged them. The idea that they all shared a single, distinctive way of speaking is pure fiction — and it was invented in a California film studio sixty-seven years ago.</p>
<p>But the accent is only the beginning. Nearly everything the modern world believes about pirates — the way they looked, the way they behaved, the things they did, the code they followed — is the product of a long chain of inventions that stretches back not to the seventeenth century but to the nineteenth, and specifically to one man: Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
<p>In 1881, Stevenson was a thirty-year-old Scottish writer living in a rented cottage in Braemar, in the Scottish Highlands. He was ill — he was always ill; tuberculosis would eventually kill him — and he was trying to entertain his twelve-year-old stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, through a rainy holiday. One afternoon, Stevenson sat down and painted a watercolour map of an imaginary island. The map showed harbours and inlets and a hill marked "Spyglass" and, in three places, small red crosses with the notation: <em>Bulk of treasure here.</em></p>
<p>The map became a story. The story became a novel. The novel was <em>Treasure Island</em>, and it was published in 1883, and it invented the pirate.</p>
<p>Not the historical pirate — the figure who had actually existed and operated in the Caribbean and the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean a century and a half earlier. Stevenson invented the <em>cultural</em> pirate — the character, the archetype, the figure that would colonise the Western imagination so thoroughly that no amount of historical scholarship has ever been able to dislodge it. Before Stevenson, pirates were criminals. After Stevenson, they were romantic.</p>
<p>Consider the inventory of things that <em>Treasure Island</em> introduced to the pirate myth. The treasure map. The X that marks the spot. The one-legged pirate. The parrot on the shoulder — Long John Silver's parrot, Captain Flint, who screeches "Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!" The buried treasure chest. The black spot — the pirate death sentence, delivered on a piece of paper. The sea shanty. The phrase "Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum." The tropical island where the treasure is hidden. The mutinous crew. The boy hero who outwits them.</p>
<p>Every one of these elements was either invented by Stevenson or so radically transformed by him that the original is unrecognisable. Real pirates did not, as a rule, bury their treasure. They did not mark maps with an X. They did not keep parrots. They did not deliver death sentences on pieces of paper. They did not sing "Yo-ho-ho." Stevenson made it all up, drawing on a few scattered historical sources and a great deal of imagination, and the world took his fiction for fact.</p>
<p>Then Hollywood got hold of it.</p>
<p>The first significant pirate film was Douglas Fairbanks's <em>The Black Pirate</em> in 1926, a silent adventure that established the visual template: the handsome rogue, the sword fight on the rigging, the damsel in distress, the ship exploding in the final act. Errol Flynn's <em>Captain Blood</em> in 1935 and <em>The Sea Hawk</em> in 1940 refined the formula, adding the swashbuckling charm and the roguish grin that would define the screen pirate for decades. By the time Newton growled his way through <em>Treasure Island</em> in 1950, the pirate had been fully assembled — a composite character built from Stevenson's imagination and Hollywood's need for spectacle, bearing almost no resemblance to the men and women who had actually sailed under the black flag.</p>
<p>And that composite character has been with us ever since. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow in <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> is the latest iteration — Newton's accent filtered through Keith Richards, Stevenson's Long John Silver reimagined as a rock star — but the template is the same one that was established more than a century ago. The costume. The accent. The buried treasure. The walking the plank. The Jolly Roger. The parrot.</p>
<p>None of it is real.</p>

      title: 'The Golden Age',
      content: `<p>The era that historians call the Golden Age of Piracy lasted roughly eighty years, from about 1650 to 1730, and it unfolded in three distinct phases across three oceans. It was not a single story. It was a series of overlapping crises — political, economic, military — that created the conditions in which thousands of men, and a handful of women, found it rational to turn criminal.</p>
<p>The first phase was the age of the buccaneers, and it began in the Caribbean in the 1650s. The buccaneers were not, originally, pirates at all. They were hunters — French and English outcasts who had settled on the island of Hispaniola and made their living killing the wild cattle and pigs that roamed the interior. They smoked the meat on wooden frames called <em>boucans</em>, and from that word they took their name. They were rough men, living in rough conditions, and when the Spanish authorities tried to drive them off Hispaniola by slaughtering the wild herds they depended on, the buccaneers took to the sea and turned their violence on Spanish shipping.</p>
<p>The timing was providential. England and France were at war with Spain — intermittently, confusingly, but persistently — and the colonial governors in Jamaica and Tortuga saw the buccaneers as a cheap navy. They issued letters of marque — official documents that licensed private ships to attack enemy vessels — and the buccaneers became privateers, legal pirates operating under the protection of the crown. The arrangement was mutually beneficial: the buccaneers got official sanction to do what they were doing anyway, and the governors got a military force that they did not have to pay, feed, or discipline.</p>
<p>The most famous of the buccaneers was Henry Morgan, and his career illustrates the blurred line between piracy and statecraft that defined the era. Morgan was a Welshman who arrived in the Caribbean in the 1650s — how he got there is unclear; he may have been an indentured servant or a soldier in Cromwell's army. By the 1660s, he was the most feared and the most successful of the buccaneer captains, commanding fleets of a dozen ships or more and leading raids against Spanish towns that were audacious in their scale and savage in their execution.</p>
<p>In 1668, Morgan attacked Portobelo, one of the most heavily fortified cities in the Spanish empire, using captured Jesuit monks and nuns as human shields. The city fell. The plunder was immense. In 1671, he crossed the Isthmus of Panama with fourteen hundred men and sacked Panama City, the richest settlement in the Americas. The city burned — Morgan claimed it was the Spanish who set the fires; the Spanish said it was Morgan — and the treasure that was carried away has never been fully accounted for.</p>
<p>Morgan was never punished. He was briefly arrested and sent to London when the raid on Panama caused a diplomatic incident, but he was treated more as a celebrity than a criminal, and he was soon returned to Jamaica with a knighthood and an appointment as Lieutenant Governor. He spent his last years as a planter and politician, drinking himself to death on Jamaican rum, and he died in 1688 rich, respected, and thoroughly unpunished.</p>
<p>The second phase of the Golden Age was the Pirate Round, which emerged in the 1690s and shifted the geography of piracy from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean. By the late seventeenth century, the Caribbean was becoming less profitable for pirates. The Spanish treasure fleets were better defended. The colonial governors were less willing to issue letters of marque. The buccaneers who remained were being squeezed between growing naval patrols and shrinking opportunities.</p>
<p>The solution was to go east. The Indian Ocean was a vast, poorly patrolled body of water where the ships of the Mughal Empire carried fabulous cargoes of silk, spices, jewels, and gold. A single Mughal treasure ship could yield more plunder than a year of Caribbean raiding. The pirates who made the journey — sailing from the American colonies or the Caribbean, around the Cape of Good Hope, and into the Indian Ocean — established bases in Madagascar, a large island off the southeast coast of Africa that was beyond the reach of any European navy.</p>
<p>The most notorious pirate of the Round was Henry Every — also spelled Avery — a former Royal Navy sailor who mutinied and seized his ship in 1694. In September 1695, Every attacked the <em>Ganj-i-Sawai</em>, a Mughal treasure ship carrying pilgrims returning from Mecca, and the result was one of the most profitable and one of the most horrific acts of piracy in history. The plunder was enormous — contemporary estimates ranged from two hundred thousand to six hundred thousand pounds, a staggering fortune — and the violence was extreme. Every's men raped and murdered passengers for days. The incident caused a diplomatic crisis between England and the Mughal Empire that threatened the entire East India Company.</p>
<p>Every was never caught. He disappeared after the raid, and his fate is unknown — some accounts say he died penniless in Devon, others that he lived out his days in comfort under an assumed name. His escape made him a legend and an inspiration to a generation of pirates who followed the same route.</p>
<p>The third and final phase was the post-Spanish Succession period, from about 1714 to 1726, and this is the era that produced the pirates we remember. The War of the Spanish Succession had ended in 1713, and its conclusion threw thousands of trained sailors out of work. The Royal Navy had employed thirty-six thousand men during the war; by 1715, the number had dropped to thirteen thousand. The discharged sailors had few legitimate options — merchant ships paid poorly, conditions were brutal, and captains ruled with a cat-o'-nine-tails — and many turned to piracy.</p>
<p>The pirate capital of this era was Nassau, on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. Nassau had been a sleepy colonial outpost, but by 1716 it had become a pirate republic — a lawless settlement of roughly a thousand pirates who had effectively seized the island and governed it themselves. The harbour was crowded with stolen ships. The taverns were full. The beach was lined with the hulls of captured vessels, stripped and abandoned. It was the closest thing to an actual pirate city that ever existed, and it was home to some of the most famous names in the history of piracy: Benjamin Hornigold, Charles Vane, Jack Rackham, Anne Bonny, Mary Read, and the man who would become the most infamous pirate in history — Edward Teach, known to the world as Blackbeard.</p>`,

      title: 'The Pirate Republic',
      content: `<p>The single most surprising fact about Golden Age pirates — the fact that Hollywood has never been able to accommodate, because it contradicts everything the genre requires — is that pirate ships were democracies.</p>
<p>Not metaphorical democracies. Not democracies in the loose, approximate sense that a group of like-minded men might be said to share authority. Real democracies, with written constitutions, elected leaders, separation of powers, term limits, and systems of social insurance that would not be matched by any nation on earth for another century.</p>
<p>Every pirate ship that operated during the Golden Age was governed by a document called the articles of agreement — sometimes called the ship's articles, or the pirate code. These articles were drawn up before a voyage began, debated by the entire crew, voted on by majority rule, and signed by every man aboard. They were binding contracts, and they covered everything: how plunder would be divided, how disputes would be settled, who would lead, and what would happen to men who broke the rules.</p>
<p>The articles of Bartholomew Roberts — the most successful pirate of the Golden Age, who captured over four hundred ships between 1719 and 1722 — have survived, and they read like the constitution of a small, violent, surprisingly progressive nation. Article I established that every man had a vote in affairs of the moment and an equal right to fresh provisions and strong liquors. Article II specified that plunder would be divided by a strict formula: the captain received two shares, the quartermaster one and a half, and every other man one share apiece. Article III required that any man who defrauded the company of even a single dollar would be marooned on an uninhabited island with a pistol, a bottle of powder, a bottle of water, and a bottle of shot.</p>
<p>Article VI is the one that startles historians. It established a system of disability compensation: any man who lost a limb in battle would receive eight hundred dollars from the common fund. The loss of a right arm was worth six hundred dollars. A left arm, five hundred. A leg, five hundred. An eye, one hundred. This was a formal insurance system, negotiated and agreed upon in advance, decades before any government or corporation offered anything comparable to its workers.</p>
<p>The captain of a pirate ship was not, as Hollywood invariably portrays him, an absolute ruler. He was an elected official. He was chosen by majority vote of the crew, and he could be removed by majority vote at any time. His authority was strictly limited to combat situations — during a chase or a battle, the captain had absolute command, because hesitation or debate could be fatal. But in all other matters, the captain was merely the first among equals. He ate the same food, drank the same water, and slept in the same conditions as every other man aboard.</p>
<p>The real power on a pirate ship belonged to the quartermaster. The quartermaster was also elected, also removable, but his authority was broader and more permanent than the captain's. He was responsible for dividing plunder, settling disputes, administering discipline, and representing the interests of the crew against the captain. He was, in effect, the speaker of the house — the people's tribune, the check on executive power. If the captain and the quartermaster disagreed, the crew voted, and the majority ruled.</p>
<p>This system was not accidental. It was a deliberate and conscious rejection of the way things worked on merchant ships and naval vessels, where captains were absolute tyrants and ordinary sailors had no rights, no representation, and no recourse. Most pirates had served on legitimate ships before turning to piracy, and they had experienced firsthand the brutality of the hierarchical system — the floggings, the starvation rations, the eighteen-hour shifts, the casual violence of officers who answered to no one. When they formed their own ships, they designed a system that was the precise opposite: egalitarian, consensual, and accountable.</p>
<p>The historian Marcus Rediker, whose work on pirate social structures is definitive, has called Golden Age pirate ships "one of the most egalitarian institutions in the Western world." The claim is not hyperbolic. In an age when every nation on earth was governed by hereditary monarchy, when slavery was legal in every European colony, when the concept of universal suffrage did not exist, pirate crews were practicing democratic self-governance with a sophistication that would not be matched by legitimate political institutions for generations.</p>
<p>Consider the contrast with the way Hollywood depicts pirate governance. In every pirate film ever made, the captain is a strongman — brilliant, charismatic, possibly insane, ruling by force of personality and the threat of violence. The crew is a mob, alternately loyal and mutinous, controlled by fear. The concept of a ship's articles is never mentioned. The quartermaster is either absent or reduced to a minor functionary. The idea that the crew might hold a democratic vote on the captain's decisions is treated as comedy, not governance.</p>
<p><em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> is typical. Captain Jack Sparrow rules by cunning and luck. Captain Barbossa rules by force. The crew is interchangeable — a collection of comic-relief rogues whose only function is to follow orders and provide background. The notion that these men might have negotiated their terms, voted on their leaders, and established a social safety net is completely absent. It has to be absent, because the democratic pirate is not a dramatic character. He is a committee member.</p>
<p>But the committee member was the reality. The swashbuckling autocrat was the fiction. And the fiction has so thoroughly replaced the reality that most people — including most people who have read extensively about pirates — find the democratic truth difficult to believe.</p>
<p>There were limits, of course. Pirate democracy was not utopian. Discipline was harsh — theft from the common store was punished by marooning, desertion by death — and the articles, for all their egalitarianism, were enforced with a violence that would be unacceptable in any modern democracy. The system worked because it was voluntary: every man who signed the articles did so freely, and every man who disagreed was free to leave, usually at the next port. It was democracy by consent, and it worked remarkably well for as long as the Golden Age lasted.</p>`,

      title: 'The Most Successful Pirate You Have Never Heard Of',
      content: `<p>If you asked a hundred people to name the most successful pirate in history, ninety of them would say Blackbeard. The other ten would say Captain Jack Sparrow, who is fictional. Almost nobody would say Bartholomew Roberts, and almost nobody would be right, because Bartholomew Roberts was the greatest pirate who ever lived, and almost nobody has heard of him.</p>
<p>Roberts — known to his contemporaries as Black Bart, though he loathed the name — captured over four hundred ships in a career that lasted just three years, from 1719 to 1722. To put that number in perspective: Blackbeard, in a career of roughly two years, captured perhaps thirty ships. Henry Morgan, in a career that spanned decades, raided perhaps a dozen towns and captured a comparable number of vessels. Roberts took four hundred. He was not just the most successful pirate of the Golden Age — he was the most successful pirate in recorded history, and he did it with a style and a discipline that makes every other pirate look like an amateur.</p>
<p>He was born John Roberts in Pembrokeshire, Wales, probably in 1682, and he went to sea young, as most Welsh boys from coastal towns did. He spent decades as a legitimate sailor, working his way through the merchant marine with the patience of a man who had no particular ambition beyond survival. In 1719, when he was thirty-seven years old, the slave ship on which he was serving as third mate was captured by a pirate named Howell Davis off the coast of West Africa.</p>
<p>Roberts did not want to be a pirate. He made this clear. He told Davis and his crew that he had no interest in their profession and that he wished to be released. They refused — Roberts was a skilled navigator, and skilled navigators were worth more than gold to a pirate crew — and Roberts was forced to sail with them. Six weeks later, Davis was killed in an ambush on the island of Princes, and the crew needed a new captain.</p>
<p>They elected Roberts. He had been a pirate for six weeks, he had done nothing to distinguish himself, and he had explicitly stated that he did not want to be there. But the crew saw something in him — a competence, a steadiness, a quality of command — and they voted him in. Roberts accepted. His reasons, as he later articulated them, were pragmatic: "In an honest Service there is thin Commons, low Wages, and hard Labour; in this, Plenty and Satiety, Pleasure and Ease, Liberty and Power." It was not a romantic statement. It was a cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>What followed was the most extraordinary three years in the history of piracy. Roberts was methodical, disciplined, and relentless. He sailed from the coast of West Africa to Brazil, where he captured a treasure fleet in the harbour of Bahia. He sailed north to Newfoundland, where he attacked the fishing fleet and captured twenty-six ships in a single morning. He returned to the Caribbean, where he prowled the shipping lanes with the efficiency of a factory trawler, taking vessel after vessel after vessel.</p>
<p>His crew operated under the strictest set of articles in pirate history. No gambling. No drinking after eight o'clock — a rule that is almost unbelievable on a pirate ship, and that Roberts enforced with an iron discipline. No fighting aboard ship — disputes were settled on shore, by duel, under the supervision of the quartermaster. Every man was required to keep his weapons clean and ready for action at all times. The musicians were given a day off on Sundays — the only men aboard who had a regular rest day.</p>
<p>Roberts himself was an anomaly among pirates. He did not drink — or rather, he drank tea, which his crew found amusing and slightly alarming. He dressed magnificently, in a crimson damask waistcoat and breeches, with a red feather in his hat and a gold chain around his neck from which hung a diamond-studded cross. He was tall, dark, handsome — adjectives that appear in multiple contemporary accounts — and he commanded with an authority that was absolute in battle and consultative in everything else.</p>
<p>He was also, by the standards of his era, remarkably violent. Not in the random, sadistic way that Hollywood attributes to pirates — Roberts did not torture prisoners for entertainment or murder for sport. His violence was strategic. He used it to build a reputation, and the reputation was the weapon. When he arrived in a harbour, ships surrendered without a fight, because everyone knew what happened to ships that did not surrender to Black Bart. The reputation did the work. The violence was the investment.</p>
<p>His end came on the morning of February 10, 1722, off Cape Lopez in present-day Gabon. HMS <em>Swallow</em>, a fifty-gun warship commanded by Captain Chaloner Ogle, caught Roberts at anchor. Roberts was eating breakfast. He dressed in his finest clothes — the crimson damask, the red feather, the diamond cross — and walked on deck to direct the battle. A burst of grapeshot struck him in the throat, and he died instantly.</p>
<p>His crew, following his standing orders, weighted his body with iron and threw it overboard before the British could capture it. Bartholomew Roberts — the most successful pirate in history, the man who took four hundred ships, the drinker of tea in a world of rum — vanished beneath the waves of the Atlantic and was never recovered. He was thirty-nine years old.</p>
<p>Hollywood has never made a film about him.</p>`,

      title: 'The Real Blackbeard',
      content: `<p>Edward Teach understood something that no pirate before him and no Hollywood screenwriter after him ever fully grasped: the most effective weapon in a pirate's arsenal is not the cannon or the cutlass. It is fear.</p>
<p>Teach — the surname is sometimes rendered as Thatch, or Thach, or Tache; the historical record is inconsistent — was probably born in Bristol around 1680, though even this basic fact is uncertain. We know almost nothing about his early life. He appears in the historical record fully formed, in 1716, as a member of the crew of Benjamin Hornigold, one of the founders of the pirate republic at Nassau. By 1717, Hornigold had given him command of a captured sloop, and by the end of that year Teach had taken a large French merchantman, armed her with forty guns, renamed her <em>Queen Anne's Revenge</em>, and begun his transformation into the most terrifying figure on the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
<p>The transformation was deliberate. It was, in modern terms, a branding exercise. Teach grew his beard — already black and thick — to an extraordinary length, braiding it into tails that he tied with ribbons. Before going into battle, he tucked slow-burning fuses — lengths of hemp cord soaked in saltpetre and limewater — into his hat and under the brim, so that his head was wreathed in wisps of sulphurous smoke. He strapped multiple pistols and daggers across his chest in a bandolier. He was tall and broad, with a deep voice, and he cultivated an air of demonic unpredictability that made even his own crew nervous.</p>
<p>The effect was precisely calculated. When the <em>Queen Anne's Revenge</em> appeared on the horizon, flying the black flag — Teach's flag showed a skeleton holding an hourglass in one hand and a spear aimed at a bleeding heart in the other — merchant captains surrendered immediately. Not because they feared being outgunned, though they often were, but because they feared what Blackbeard would do if they resisted. The fuses, the beard, the flag, the reputation — they were a psychological weapon system, and they worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>Here is the fact that demolishes every Hollywood portrayal of Blackbeard: there is no verified account of Edward Teach ever killing a single person — before his final battle.</p>
<p>The statement needs qualification. Teach was certainly involved in violent engagements, and people were certainly killed in the course of his raids. But there is no documented case of Teach personally murdering a captive, torturing a prisoner to death, or committing the kind of casual, sadistic violence that every film about Blackbeard depicts as his defining characteristic. He did not need to. The image did the work. The smoking fuses and the bristling armament and the terrifying flag told merchant captains everything they needed to know, and they hauled down their colours and handed over their cargo without a shot being fired.</p>
<p>This is the paradox at the heart of Blackbeard's story: the most famous pirate in history was famous precisely because he was so good at not having to fight. His entire career was an exercise in theatrical intimidation, and it was extraordinarily effective. In roughly two years of active piracy, Teach captured approximately thirty ships — a respectable but not exceptional total — and acquired a fortune in plunder with remarkably little bloodshed.</p>
<p>His most audacious act was the blockade of Charleston, South Carolina, in May 1718. Teach anchored his fleet — four ships, roughly three hundred men — at the entrance to Charleston harbour and simply stopped all traffic in and out. For a week, he held one of the most important ports in the American colonies hostage, capturing nine ships and taking their passengers prisoner. His demand was not gold or jewels. It was a chest of medicine — his crew was suffering from venereal disease, and he needed mercury treatments. The governor of South Carolina, humiliated, delivered the medicine. Teach released his prisoners, most of whom were unharmed, and sailed away.</p>
<p>The blockade was an act of supreme confidence. Teach was not just robbing ships — he was robbing an entire city, openly, in broad daylight, and daring the colonial government to do something about it. The government could not. The Royal Navy had no ships in the area. The colonial militia was not equipped to fight a naval engagement. Teach had calculated, correctly, that he was untouchable, and he rubbed the establishment's face in it.</p>
<p>His end, when it came, was spectacularly violent. On the morning of November 22, 1718, two sloops commanded by Lieutenant Robert Maynard of the Royal Navy found the <em>Adventure</em> — Teach had by then abandoned the <em>Queen Anne's Revenge</em> — anchored in a shallow inlet at Ocracoke, on the outer banks of North Carolina. The engagement was brief and savage. Teach boarded Maynard's sloop and fought hand-to-hand on the deck, sustaining five gunshot wounds and more than twenty cuts from swords and knives before he finally collapsed and died.</p>
<p>Maynard cut off his head and hung it from the bowsprit of his sloop. It dangled there for the entire voyage back to Virginia, dripping into the sea, a trophy and a warning. The body was thrown overboard. According to legend — a legend that is almost certainly false but has never quite been dispelled — the headless body swam three times around the ship before sinking.</p>
<p>Blackbeard was dead. The myth was just beginning.</p>`,

      content: `<p>In November 1720, a sloop called the <em>William</em> was captured by a British naval vessel in Dry Harbour Bay, off the western coast of Jamaica. The pirates aboard were drunk — all of them, sprawled on the deck or collapsed in the hold, incapable of resistance. All of them except two.</p>
<p>Two figures stood on deck as the naval boarding party climbed over the rail. They were armed with cutlasses and pistols. They were fighting. They were, according to every account that has survived, the only members of the crew who put up any resistance at all. And they were women.</p>
<p>Anne Bonny and Mary Read are the most famous female pirates in history, and their story has been told so many times and in so many ways that separating fact from legend is almost impossible. What is certain is this: they sailed with the pirate John "Calico Jack" Rackham, they were tried and convicted of piracy at a Vice Admiralty court in Spanish Town, Jamaica, on November 28, 1720, and they escaped the gallows by "pleading their bellies" — declaring that they were pregnant, which under English law meant their executions had to be postponed until after they gave birth.</p>
<p>Anne Bonny was Irish — born in County Cork, probably around 1700, the illegitimate daughter of a lawyer and his maid. Her father took her to the American colonies, where he prospered as a planter in South Carolina. Anne, by all accounts, was smart, fierce-tempered, and spectacularly unsuited to the role of planter's daughter. She married a small-time sailor named James Bonny, against her father's wishes, and the couple drifted to Nassau, which was still, in 1718, the closest thing the Caribbean had to a pirate capital.</p>
<p>In Nassau, she met Rackham — a charming, flamboyant pirate who earned his nickname from the calico clothing he wore — and she left her husband for him. When Rackham returned to piracy, Anne went with him, dressing as a man and fighting alongside the crew. The disguise may not have been very convincing — several accounts suggest that the crew knew she was a woman — but it was maintained as a formality, and Anne fought, by all reports, as well as any man aboard.</p>
<p>Mary Read's story is even more remarkable. She had been disguised as a man since childhood — her mother dressed her as a boy to collect an inheritance intended for a deceased older brother — and she had served in the British Army, fighting in the War of the Spanish Succession in the Low Countries. After the war, she married a Flemish soldier, and when he died, she returned to men's clothing, joined a ship's crew, and was captured by pirates. She ended up on Rackham's sloop, where she and Bonny recognised each other as women and, according to tradition, became close friends.</p>
<p>Their trial was a sensation. Two women, dressed as men, convicted of piracy — it was the kind of story that the press of 1720 was designed to exploit, and exploit it they did. The trial records, which survive, show that both women were active and willing participants in piracy. Witnesses testified that they "were both very profligate, cursing and swearing much, and very ready and willing to do any Thing on Board." They handled weapons. They boarded ships. They fought. The court had no difficulty convicting them.</p>
<p>But Bonny and Read were not anomalies. They were the most visible examples of a broader truth about Golden Age piracy that Hollywood has systematically erased: pirate ships were among the most diverse institutions in the Western world.</p>
<p>The crews of pirate vessels during the Golden Age included men — and occasionally women — from every part of the Atlantic world. Englishmen, Scots, Irish, Welsh, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Danes, Swedes, Americans, and Africans sailed together on pirate ships, and the African presence was substantial. Historians estimate that between twenty-five and thirty per cent of pirate crews during the Golden Age were Black — some of them formerly enslaved people who had been freed when pirate ships captured slave vessels, others who had joined voluntarily.</p>
<p>The status of Black pirates was complicated and varied from ship to ship. On some vessels, Black crew members were treated as equals — they signed the articles, they voted, they received their share of plunder. On others, they were given subordinate roles, assigned to the heaviest labour, and denied full shares. The historical record is fragmentary and contradictory. But what is clear is that pirate ships, for all their imperfections, were significantly more egalitarian in matters of race than any other institution of their era. In a world where millions of Africans were being transported across the Atlantic in chains, pirate ships offered something that no plantation, no merchant vessel, and no navy could match: the possibility, however imperfect, of equality.</p>
<p>Blackbeard's crew included a significant number of Black sailors. Bartholomew Roberts sailed with crews that were at least a quarter African. Sam Bellamy, the "Prince of Pirates" who went down with the <em>Whydah</em> in 1717, captained a crew that included at least twenty-five Africans, many of them formerly enslaved people who had been freed when Bellamy captured a slave ship.</p>
<p>Hollywood has never known what to do with this. The pirate film is, by long tradition, a genre of white men in big hats — and occasionally a white woman in a corset — and the diversity of actual pirate crews has been invisible on screen for a century. When Black characters appear in pirate films, they are usually confined to marginal roles. The idea that a quarter or a third of the crew might have been African, that former slaves and free men sailed and fought and voted alongside European sailors, that the pirate ship was one of the few places in the early eighteenth century where a Black man might live and die as something other than property — this truth is absent from every pirate movie ever made.</p>
<p>Anne Bonny's last recorded words were to Calico Jack Rackham, who was brought to her cell the night before his execution. She looked at him and said: "Had you fought like a man, you need not have been hanged like a dog."</p>
<p>It is the best exit line in the history of piracy, and Hollywood has been trying to match it for a hundred years.</p>`,

      content: `<p>The most persistent myth about pirates — more persistent than the accent, more persistent than the eye patch, more persistent even than the plank — is the buried treasure. The chest of gold and jewels, hidden on a remote island, marked on a crumbling map with an X. It is the central image of pirate mythology, the engine of a thousand stories, and it is almost entirely false.</p>
<p>Real pirates did not bury their treasure. The reason is simple and economic: treasure that is buried is treasure that is not being spent, and pirates, as a class, were extraordinarily bad at not spending money. The entire point of piracy was immediate gratification — to take what the world owed you and enjoy it now, today, tonight, in the taverns and brothels of Nassau or Port Royal or Madagascar. A pirate who buried his loot was a pirate who had missed the point.</p>
<p>There is exactly one well-documented case of a pirate burying treasure, and it involves Captain William Kidd, and the story is not what you think.</p>
<p>Kidd was not, in the conventional sense, a pirate at all. He was a Scottish sea captain who was commissioned in 1695 by a consortium of English lords — including the Earl of Bellomont, the governor of New York — to hunt pirates in the Indian Ocean. He was given a letter of marque, a ship called the <em>Adventure Galley</em>, and instructions to attack French vessels and pirate ships and bring the plunder back to his investors. It was a business arrangement, sanctioned by the crown, and Kidd sailed from New York as a privateer, not a pirate.</p>
<p>What happened next is a matter of intense historical debate. Kidd's voyage was a disaster. The <em>Adventure Galley</em> leaked. His crew was mutinous. He found no pirates and captured no French ships. Under pressure from his crew and his investors, Kidd began attacking ships that were neither French nor pirate — most notably the <em>Quedagh Merchant</em>, an Armenian-owned vessel sailing under a French pass. The capture of the <em>Quedagh Merchant</em> was technically legal — the French pass made it a lawful prize under Kidd's commission — but the ship's cargo belonged to a minister of the Mughal court, and the seizure caused a diplomatic uproar.</p>
<p>By the time Kidd returned to the American colonies in 1699, he had been declared a pirate. His noble backers, embarrassed by the controversy, had disowned him. He was a wanted man, and he knew it. In a last, desperate attempt to buy his way out of trouble, Kidd buried a portion of his plunder — gold, silver, jewels, and trade goods — on Gardiners Island, a small island at the eastern end of Long Island Sound. He intended to use it as a bargaining chip: evidence of his haul that he could offer to the authorities in exchange for clemency.</p>
<p>The bargain failed. Kidd was arrested, sent to London, tried for piracy and murder, and hanged at Execution Dock in Wapping on May 23, 1701. His body was coated in tar, locked in an iron cage, and suspended from a gibbet over the Thames, where it hung for years as a warning to sailors.</p>
<p>The treasure on Gardiners Island was recovered by the authorities almost immediately. It was modest — worth perhaps fourteen thousand pounds, a fraction of what legend would later attribute to it. There was no map. There was no X. It was not hidden in a cave or a chest on a tropical beach. It was buried in a shallow hole on a sheep farm in Long Island.</p>
<p>But the story of Kidd's buried treasure — embellished, exaggerated, and romanticised over the centuries — became one of the sources for Stevenson's <em>Treasure Island</em>, and from Stevenson it passed into the permanent mythology of piracy. The treasure map with the X. The chest of doubloons. The remote island. The coded instructions. All of it traces back, ultimately, to a few bags of gold and silver buried in a hurry on a Long Island sheep farm by a desperate man trying to save his neck.</p>
<p>What about walking the plank? It ranks alongside buried treasure as one of the iconic images of piracy — the blindfolded captive, forced at sword point to walk a wooden board extending over the ocean, dropping to his death in the shark-infested waters below. Howard Pyle painted it. J.M. Barrie wrote it. Every pirate movie features it or references it.</p>
<p>The historical evidence for the practice is almost nonexistent. There are a handful of accounts — two or three at most — that describe something resembling walking the plank, and they date from the early nineteenth century, well after the Golden Age. The most often cited is an account from 1829, nearly a century after the end of the period. During the Golden Age itself, there is no reliable record of any pirate making a captive walk a plank.</p>
<p>What pirates actually did to captives was both simpler and more varied. Most captives were released unharmed — piracy was a business, and dead captives could not pay ransoms, could not provide information about future targets, and could not spread the word that surrendering to pirates was the safe and sensible option. Pirates wanted a reputation for leniency toward those who cooperated, because that reputation made future targets more likely to surrender without a fight.</p>
<p>Those who resisted, however, could expect no mercy. Pirates who encountered resistance punished it severely, because the entire business model depended on the credible threat of violence. Captives who fought back were beaten, whipped, burned, mutilated, or killed — often in creative and public ways designed to maximise the deterrent effect. The violence was not random. It was advertising.</p>
<p>And the eye patch? The peg leg? The hook for a hand? All of these are real, in the sense that sailors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries suffered injuries with terrible frequency, and prosthetics and patches were common. But they were not distinctive to pirates. They were common to all maritime professions. A merchant sailor was just as likely to lose an eye or a limb as a pirate — and a naval sailor, engaged in full-scale fleet actions, was probably more likely. The eye patch and the peg leg became pirate symbols because Stevenson put them on Long John Silver, and Hollywood put them on everyone else.</p>
<p>The parrot, at least, has some basis in fact. Sailors in the tropics did sometimes keep exotic birds as pets, and parrots were particularly prized because they could be taught to talk and because they were easy to feed. But the parrot as the pirate's signature accessory — perched on the shoulder, squawking "Pieces of eight!" — is, once again, Stevenson. Captain Flint, Long John Silver's parrot, is the ancestor of every shoulder bird in every pirate story since 1883.</p>`,

      title: 'The End of the Age',
      content: `<p>The Golden Age of Piracy did not fade away. It was killed — systematically, deliberately, and efficiently — by a man named Woodes Rogers, and the weapon he used was not a warship. It was a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Rogers was a privateer himself — a Bristol-born sea captain who had circumnavigated the globe between 1708 and 1711, raiding Spanish shipping in the Pacific and rescuing the castaway Alexander Selkirk from the island of Juan Fernandez, the real-life inspiration for Robinson Crusoe. He was a practical man, a man of action, and when the British government appointed him Royal Governor of the Bahamas in 1718, he understood precisely what he was being asked to do: destroy the pirate republic at Nassau.</p>
<p>Rogers arrived in Nassau in July 1718 with a small fleet and a royal proclamation — the King's Pardon. The terms were simple: any pirate who surrendered and swore to abandon piracy would be pardoned for all past crimes. No prosecution. No punishment. A clean slate. The offer had an expiration date, and the deadline was immovable.</p>
<p>The pardon was a masterstroke of strategy. It exploited the fundamental weakness of the pirate republic — which was that most pirates were not, in fact, committed ideologues. They were pragmatists who had turned to crime because the alternatives were worse, and if they were offered a way out that did not involve the gallows, many of them would take it. Rogers understood this. He understood that the pirate community was not a monolith but a coalition of individuals with different motivations, different risk tolerances, and different visions of the future, and he designed the pardon to split the coalition apart.</p>
<p>It worked. Within weeks of Rogers's arrival, hundreds of pirates had accepted the pardon. Benjamin Hornigold — one of the founders of the republic, one of the most senior pirates in Nassau — was among the first to surrender. He subsequently agreed to hunt his former colleagues, and he spent the last years of his life as a pirate hunter, pursuing men he had once commanded. The irony was lost on no one.</p>
<p>Not everyone accepted. Charles Vane — temperamental, violent, and ideologically committed to piracy in a way that most of his peers were not — refused the pardon and sailed out of Nassau harbour with his guns blazing, firing on Rogers's fleet as he went. Jack Rackham, who had served under Vane, eventually accepted the pardon and then returned to piracy, which would prove fatal. Blackbeard, operating out of North Carolina rather than Nassau, was beyond the reach of the pardon and had to be dealt with by force — which Lieutenant Maynard did, definitively, in November 1718.</p>
<p>Rogers's campaign against the remaining pirates was relentless. He fortified Nassau. He established a court. He hanged pirates who were captured — publicly, on the waterfront, where the bodies could be seen from the harbour. He was making a point, and the point was unmistakable: the age of impunity was over. Piracy would no longer be tolerated, overlooked, or quietly encouraged. It would be prosecuted, and it would be punished, and the punishment would be death.</p>
<p>The effect was devastating. Within three years of Rogers's arrival, Nassau had been transformed from a pirate capital into a functioning colonial settlement. The harbour that had been choked with stolen ships was now open to legitimate trade. The taverns that had catered to pirates were catering to merchants. The beach that had been lined with abandoned hulls was being cleared. The pirate republic was dead.</p>
<p>The end came in stages. Blackbeard was killed in November 1718. Stede Bonnet — the "gentleman pirate," a wealthy Barbadian planter who had turned to piracy out of what appears to have been a midlife crisis — was captured and hanged in December 1718. Charles Vane was captured, tried, and hanged in 1721. Jack Rackham and his crew — including Anne Bonny and Mary Read — were captured and tried in November 1720. Rackham was hanged; Bonny and Read, pregnant, were spared. Bartholomew Roberts, the last of the great pirates, was killed in battle in February 1722.</p>
<p>By 1726, the Golden Age was over. The combination of the King's Pardon, increased naval patrols, the hanging of captured pirates, and the gradual improvement of conditions on merchant ships — slightly better pay, slightly less brutal discipline — had eliminated the conditions that had made piracy viable. There were still pirates after 1726, just as there are still pirates today, but the phenomenon had changed. It was no longer a mass movement. It was no longer a viable career. It was no longer possible for a thousand armed men to seize an island in the Caribbean and declare themselves a republic.</p>
<p>What remained was the myth.</p>
<p>And the myth, as myths do, grew. It grew through Stevenson and Barrie and Flynn and Newton and Disney and Depp, each iteration adding new layers of invention and stripping away another layer of reality, until the pirate of popular culture bore almost no resemblance to the pirate of history. The real pirate — democratic, diverse, pragmatic, frequently boring, occasionally terrifying — was replaced by the Hollywood pirate — autocratic, white, romantic, consistently entertaining, and approximately as historically accurate as a theme park ride.</p>
<p>The irony is that the real story is better. The truth of Golden Age piracy — the democratic constitutions, the disability insurance, the diverse crews, the tea-drinking Welsh navigator who captured four hundred ships, the Irish woman who was braver than her captain, the Cornish accent that was invented in a California sound stage — is stranger, richer, and more surprising than anything Hollywood has ever put on screen.</p>
<p>But Hollywood does not want the real story. Hollywood wants the costume, the accent, the treasure map, the parrot, and the plank. And so the myth endures, and the reality fades, and every year on September 19 — International Talk Like a Pirate Day, a holiday that exists because two friends in Oregon decided it should — millions of people around the world roll their Rs and say "Arrr" in an accent that no pirate ever spoke, celebrating a character that no pirate ever was, in honour of a history that never happened.</p>
