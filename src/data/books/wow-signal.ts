      content: `<p>The Big Ear radio telescope did not look like a telescope. It looked like a mistake — like someone had started building a football stadium, lost interest halfway through, and wandered off to do something else. It sat on a flat expanse of farmland near Delaware, Ohio, about twenty-five miles north of Columbus, and from a distance it resembled nothing so much as a very large, very strange fence.</p>
<p>What it was, in fact, was one of the most sensitive radio telescopes ever built. Designed by a man named John D. Kraus — an electrical engineer of formidable talent and mild eccentricity — it consisted of two enormous reflectors arranged at opposite ends of a flat aluminium ground plane the size of three football fields. The ground plane was 110 metres long and 150 metres wide. One reflector was a fixed parabolic wall, curved and standing 21 metres tall. The other was a flat, tiltable panel that could be angled to direct signals from different parts of the sky into the parabolic reflector, which then focused them into two horn-shaped receivers mounted on a movable carriage.</p>
<p>Kraus had started building it in 1956. It took seven years to finish. The university called it the Ohio State University Radio Observatory. Everyone else called it Big Ear.</p>
<p>For its first decade, Big Ear had been used for conventional radio astronomy — mapping distant galaxies, cataloguing radio sources, the sort of painstaking survey work that produces important data and very little excitement. But in December 1973, something changed. Robert S. Dixon, the observatory's director, received approval to repurpose the telescope for a different kind of listening. Big Ear would join the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.</p>
<p>SETI. The idea was simple, the implications were staggering, and the odds were terrible. Somewhere out there — in the vast, cold, mostly empty universe — there might be other civilisations. They might be broadcasting. If they were, the signals would be radio waves, because radio waves travel at the speed of light, pass through dust and gas largely unimpeded, and can be detected across interstellar distances with equipment that fits on a single planet. The question was where to point the telescope, and what frequency to listen on.</p>
<p>The frequency question had been answered, at least in theory, nearly fifteen years earlier. In 1959, two Cornell physicists named Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison had published a paper in <em>Nature</em> that would become the founding document of SETI. Their argument was elegant. If an alien civilisation wanted to send a signal that would be noticed — that would stand out against the background noise of the cosmos — it would choose a frequency that any technologically advanced species would recognise. The most obvious candidate was 1420 megahertz: the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe. Every hydrogen atom in existence broadcasts at that frequency when its electron flips spin. It is, in a sense, the universe's natural tuning fork.</p>
<p>Cocconi and Morrison called it "a unique, objective standard of frequency, which must be known to every observer in the universe." If aliens were trying to get our attention, they would broadcast on the hydrogen line. If we were trying to hear them, that is where we should listen.</p>
<p>Big Ear listened. It listened all day, every day, for years. It was a transit telescope, which meant it could not track objects across the sky. Instead, it sat still while the Earth rotated beneath it, sweeping the telescope's narrow beam across the heavens from west to east. Any given point in the sky passed through the beam for exactly seventy-two seconds — the time it took the Earth's rotation to carry that point from one edge of the beam to the other. Then it was gone, and the next patch of sky took its place.</p>
<p>The telescope's receivers fed their data into an IBM 1130 computer, a machine the size of a large desk that was powerful by 1960s standards and modest by any other. The 1130 processed the incoming radio signals, divided them into fifty channels — each ten kilohertz wide, centred on the hydrogen line — and printed the results on continuous-feed paper in an alphanumeric code. Blank spaces meant no signal above background noise. Numbers 1 through 9 indicated increasingly strong signals. If a signal exceeded nine times the background noise, the computer switched to letters: A for 10, B for 11, and so on up through the alphabet.</p>
<p>Most of the printout was blank. Occasionally a 1 or a 2 would appear — a blip, a fluctuation, atmospheric noise. The volunteers who reviewed the data had learned to scan the columns of numbers with a kind of detached patience, the way a sentry watches a road on which nothing ever comes.</p>
<p>The Ohio SETI program ran like this for nearly four years. It was the longest continuous SETI search in history. Nothing happened. The printout rolled off the IBM 1130, page after page, day after day, and the columns of numbers said the same thing over and over: nothing here, nothing here, nothing here.</p>
<p>Then, on the night of August 15, 1977, something happened.</p>`,

      content: `<p>Nobody was there when it arrived.</p>
<p>This is the first thing to understand about the Wow! Signal, and in some ways it is the most important: nobody heard it in real time. Big Ear was an automated observatory. There was no one sitting in a control room with headphones, listening. The telescope collected data; the IBM 1130 processed it; the line printer printed it. If something extraordinary came in at 10:16 on a Tuesday night — or, as was the case, at 11:16 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on a Monday — the computer recorded it with the same indifferent precision it applied to everything else, and the paper rolled on, and the telescope kept scanning.</p>
<p>What arrived that night came from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, roughly two and a half degrees south of the star group Chi Sagittarii, near the star Tau Sagittarii. It came from a part of the sky that is unremarkable to the naked eye — no bright stars, no obvious nebulae, just another patch in the dense star fields that crowd the sky near the galactic centre. It was approximately 19 degrees southeast of the plane of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>The signal appeared in a single channel: channel 2, centred on a frequency of 1420.4556 megahertz. The hydrogen line. It appeared in no other channel. This was significant. Natural radio sources — galaxies, quasars, pulsars — tend to emit across a wide band of frequencies. A signal confined to a single narrow channel suggested something artificial. Something deliberate.</p>
<p>The signal's intensity rose gradually over the first thirty-six seconds, peaked, and then fell away over the next thirty-six seconds, tracing a smooth bell curve — a Gaussian profile, in the language of signal processing. This, too, was significant. It was exactly the pattern you would expect from a distant point source passing through Big Ear's beam as the Earth rotated. A terrestrial source — a satellite, a military transmitter, a malfunctioning piece of electronics — would not produce this pattern. It would appear suddenly, persist irregularly, and vanish without the mathematical symmetry of a Gaussian curve.</p>
<p>The entire event lasted seventy-two seconds. Then it was over. The signal faded back into the noise, and the beam moved on, and the printer kept printing.</p>
<p>Big Ear had two feed horns — two separate receivers that pointed at slightly different patches of sky, separated by about forty arc-minutes. A genuine astronomical source passing through the beam would appear first in one horn, then, a few minutes later, in the other. The Wow! Signal appeared in only one horn. It did not appear in the second. This meant one of two things: either the source had turned off in the few minutes between the two observations, or the signal was some kind of interference that affected only one receiver.</p>
<p>But the Gaussian profile argued against interference. And the frequency — the hydrogen line, protected by international agreement, forbidden to terrestrial transmitters — argued against any known earthly source.</p>
<p>The IBM 1130 recorded the signal's intensity in its alphanumeric code. As the signal rose through the noise, the printer set down a 6 — six times background. Then E — fourteen to fifteen times. Then Q — twenty-six to twenty-seven times. Then U — thirty to thirty-one times, the peak. Then J — nineteen to twenty times, falling now. Then 5 — five times, fading fast, almost gone.</p>
<p>6EQUJ5.</p>
<p>Six characters on a continuous-feed printout. The strongest signal the Ohio SETI program had ever recorded. The strongest narrowband signal any SETI program had ever recorded. It sat there on the paper, unremarked, unnoticed, waiting for someone to find it.</p>
<p>The paper rolled on. The telescope kept listening. The night ended, and the morning came, and the data accumulated in neat stacks beside the printer, and nobody knew.</p>`,

      content: `<p>Jerry Ehman found it several days later.</p>
<p>Ehman was an astronomer — a real one, with a PhD from the University of Michigan — but his position at Ohio State was not what you would call glamorous. He had joined the faculty in 1967 and would remain there until 2008, working in various capacities that ranged from research associate to adjunct professor, never quite achieving the security of tenure. He was a quiet man, careful, methodical, the sort of scientist who finds satisfaction in data rather than drama. He had been volunteering on the SETI project since it began, reviewing the printouts that the IBM 1130 produced, scanning columns of numbers for anything unusual.</p>
<p>It was tedious work. The printouts were long — pages and pages of blank spaces and low numbers, the cosmic equivalent of dead air. Ehman would take them home and spread them out on his kitchen table and go through them column by column, line by line, looking for patterns. He had been doing this for years. He had found nothing.</p>
<p>On this particular day — the exact date is not recorded, but it was a few days after August 15 — Ehman sat down with the latest batch of printouts and began his review. He worked through the data methodically, as always, his eyes moving across the columns with the practised speed of someone who has done this a thousand times before.</p>
<p>And then he saw it.</p>
<p>6EQUJ5.</p>
<p>The sequence jumped off the page. In years of reviewing data, Ehman had never seen a signal reach the letter range, let alone climb to U — thirty standard deviations above the background noise. The intensity profile was unmistakable: a smooth rise and fall, precisely matching the beam pattern, precisely matching what a distant point source would produce. It was in a single channel. It was on the hydrogen line.</p>
<p>Ehman picked up a red pen. He circled the sequence. And in the left margin of the printout, in neat block letters, he wrote a single word.</p>
<p><em>Wow!</em></p>
<p>It was not a scientific assessment. It was not a hypothesis or a conclusion or even a particularly informative annotation. It was the involuntary exclamation of a man who had spent four years listening to silence and had suddenly heard something. It was the only honest thing he could think to write.</p>
<p>That single word — scrawled in red ink on a computer printout in an astronomer's kitchen in Ohio — would become the most famous marginal notation in the history of science. It would give the signal its name, a name that stuck because it was perfect: informal, human, and slightly breathless, the opposite of the measured, cautious language that scientists are supposed to use. The Wow! Signal. You could hear the exclamation mark.</p>
<p>Ehman brought the printout to Bob Dixon. Dixon examined it. They went through the data together, checking the numbers, verifying the channel, confirming the time and sky position. Everything was consistent. The signal was real — it was not a processing error, not a printer malfunction, not a glitch in the IBM 1130. Something had produced a burst of narrowband radio energy at 1420 megahertz, from the direction of Sagittarius, lasting exactly seventy-two seconds, with a peak intensity thirty times above the noise floor.</p>
<p>The question was what.</p>
<p>Dixon and Ehman did not hold a press conference. They did not call NASA. They did what scientists do: they looked for the signal again. Over the following weeks and months, Big Ear was pointed back at the same patch of sky, again and again, at the same frequency, with the same equipment. The telescope listened.</p>
<p>The signal did not come back.</p>
<p>They tried different times of day, different seasons, different receiver configurations. They checked for equipment malfunctions. They examined the possibility of terrestrial interference — military radar, aircraft transponders, satellite downlinks. Nothing matched. The frequency was in a protected band; no legitimate transmitter on Earth operated at 1420 megahertz. The Gaussian profile ruled out most forms of local interference. The signal had all the hallmarks of a genuine astronomical source.</p>
<p>But a genuine astronomical source should repeat. Stars do not turn on and off. Galaxies do not broadcast once and then go silent. If the signal was coming from a natural emitter — a hydrogen cloud, a peculiar star, some unknown astrophysical phenomenon — it should still be there, and Big Ear should be able to find it again.</p>
<p>It could not. The sky, where the signal had been, was silent. Whatever had spoken had stopped speaking, and nobody knew why.</p>`,

      title: 'The Frequency',
      content: `<p>To understand why the Wow! Signal mattered — why it was not just an interesting blip but a genuinely extraordinary event — you have to understand why 1420 megahertz is special.</p>
<p>Every atom of hydrogen in the universe exists in one of two energy states. In the lower state, the spin of the atom's single electron is opposite to the spin of its proton — antiparallel, in physics jargon. In the upper state, the spins are aligned — parallel. When a hydrogen atom flips from the upper state to the lower state, it releases a tiny amount of energy in the form of a photon at a frequency of precisely 1420.405751 megahertz. This is the hydrogen line, also known as the 21-centimetre line, because the corresponding wavelength is about 21 centimetres.</p>
<p>The hydrogen line is the most common electromagnetic emission in the universe. Hydrogen is the most abundant element — roughly three-quarters of all ordinary matter — and the spin-flip transition happens constantly, everywhere, in every cloud of interstellar gas, in every galaxy. Radio astronomers had first detected it in 1951, and it had been a cornerstone of radio astronomy ever since. It was used to map the structure of the Milky Way, to measure the rotation of galaxies, to study the distribution of matter in the cosmos.</p>
<p>But it had another significance, one that had nothing to do with conventional astronomy. In 1959, Cocconi and Morrison had argued that the hydrogen line was the natural frequency for interstellar communication. Their reasoning was disarmingly simple. Any civilisation capable of radio astronomy would know about the hydrogen line. It was universal, fundamental, and unambiguous — a frequency determined by the laws of physics, not by local convention. It was, as they wrote, "a unique, objective standard."</p>
<p>Moreover, the hydrogen line sat in a remarkably quiet part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Below 1420 megahertz, the sky was noisy with synchrotron radiation from the Milky Way. Above about 1660 megahertz — the frequency of the hydroxyl radical, OH — the sky was noisy with atmospheric water vapour. But between these two frequencies, in the band that radio astronomers called the "water hole," the universe was relatively silent. Hydrogen and hydroxyl — H and OH — combine to form water, H2O. The water hole. It was a cosmic oasis of quiet, a frequency range where a faint signal could travel vast distances without being drowned out by natural noise.</p>
<p>The poetry was not lost on SETI researchers. The water hole — the place where civilisations might gather to drink from the cosmic well. It was almost too neat, too allegorical, but the physics was real. A civilisation that wanted its signal to be heard would broadcast in the water hole, and it would choose the hydrogen line because hydrogen was everywhere and everyone would know it.</p>
<p>This was the theoretical framework that the Ohio SETI program was built on. Big Ear was listening on the hydrogen line because Cocconi and Morrison had told them to, and Cocconi and Morrison had told them to because the physics demanded it.</p>
<p>And then something came in. On the hydrogen line. In a single narrow channel. With the Gaussian signature of a distant point source. From the direction of Sagittarius.</p>
<p>The signal matched every prediction that Cocconi and Morrison had made eighteen years earlier. It was narrowband — no natural source known to science produced a narrowband signal at the hydrogen frequency. It was strong — far stronger than any background fluctuation. It was in the water hole. It came from a direction near the galactic centre, where the density of stars is highest and the probability of finding another civilisation, if civilisations exist at all, is presumably greatest.</p>
<p>If you had sat down in advance and listed the characteristics of an ideal SETI detection — the kind of signal you would design an experiment to find — you would have described the Wow! Signal. It was the textbook case. The only problem was that textbook cases are supposed to come with textbook explanations, and this one did not.</p>
<p>One signal, seventy-two seconds, never repeated. It was like hearing a single word shouted in a language you almost recognise, turning to look, and finding an empty room.</p>`,

      title: 'The Search',
      content: `<p>They looked for it everywhere. For decades. With better and better instruments. They never found it.</p>
<p>Big Ear itself made the first follow-up attempts. In the weeks after Ehman's discovery, the telescope was repeatedly aimed at the same coordinates in Sagittarius. The strategy was simple: if the signal was coming from a fixed source — a star, a planet, an alien transmitter — it should be there every time the telescope swept past. It was there none of the times.</p>
<p>The Ohio SETI program continued running until December 1997, twenty-four years after it began. In all that time, Big Ear returned to the Wow! Signal's coordinates hundreds of times. The signal never reappeared. Other anomalies were detected — brief spikes, statistical outliers — but nothing that matched the intensity, the duration, or the frequency characteristics of the 1977 event.</p>
<p>Robert H. Gray took up the chase. Gray was an unusual figure in the SETI community — he was not a professional astronomer but a data analyst from Chicago who had become fascinated by the Wow! Signal and had decided to dedicate his spare time to finding it again. He was methodical, persistent, and slightly obsessive, qualities that serve well in science and in the particular form of stubbornness required to spend decades looking for something that might not exist.</p>
<p>In 1987 and again in 1989, Gray used the Harvard-Smithsonian META array at Oak Ridge Observatory in Massachusetts to search for the signal. META — the Megachannel Extra-Terrestrial Assay — was a SETI system that could monitor 8.4 million channels simultaneously, an enormous improvement over Big Ear's fifty. Gray pointed it at the Wow! Signal's coordinates and listened. Nothing.</p>
<p>In 1995, Gray secured time on the Very Large Array in New Mexico — twenty-seven radio dishes arranged in a Y-shaped configuration across the desert, each twenty-five metres in diameter, together simulating a single antenna up to thirty-six kilometres wide. The VLA was one of the most powerful radio telescopes on Earth. Gray was the first amateur astronomer in history to use it. He was given the time because the professionals had given up, or moved on, or both, and because Gray had written a convincing proposal and was willing to pay for the observation time himself.</p>
<p>He observed the Wow! Signal's coordinates in September 1995 and again in May 1996, working with Kevin Marvel, a professional astronomer who co-authored the resulting paper. The VLA's sensitivity was extraordinary — it could detect signals far fainter than anything Big Ear could have picked up. If the source was still there, even at a fraction of its original intensity, the VLA would find it.</p>
<p>The VLA found nothing.</p>
<p>In 1995, H. Paul Shuch, the executive director of the SETI League, conducted his own search using a twelve-metre radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia. Green Bank sits in the United States National Radio Quiet Zone, a 13,000-square-mile area where radio transmissions are severely restricted to protect the observatory's sensitive instruments. If any location on Earth was free from the kind of radio interference that might mask a faint signal, it was Green Bank.</p>
<p>The result was the same. Silence.</p>
<p>Gray never stopped looking. He continued to search for the signal with various instruments over the following years, and in 2001 he and Marvel published their VLA results in <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>. The paper was careful and precise and amounted to a single conclusion: the signal was not there. Whatever had produced it in 1977 was either gone, or intermittent, or so faint that even the VLA could not detect it.</p>
<p>Gray wrote a book about his quest. He called it <em>The Elusive Wow</em>. It was a fitting title. The signal had become a kind of ghost — something that had been seen once, by one instrument, on one night, and had left behind a single piece of physical evidence: a printout with "Wow!" written in the margin.</p>
<p>In 2012, on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the signal's detection, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico beamed a response. The transmission was aimed at the region of sky from which the Wow! Signal had originated and contained ten thousand messages from Twitter users around the world. It was more publicity stunt than science — the messages would take hundreds of years to reach even the nearest stars in that direction — but it spoke to something real: the signal had not been forgotten. It had entered the cultural imagination in a way that few scientific observations ever do.</p>
<p>In 2022, Breakthrough Listen — a privately funded SETI initiative backed by Russian-Israeli billionaire Yuri Milner — conducted a comprehensive search of the Wow! Signal's coordinates using the Green Bank Telescope and the Allen Telescope Array. The Green Bank Telescope was the world's largest fully steerable radio dish, one hundred metres in diameter, vastly more sensitive than anything available in 1977. The Allen Telescope Array, operated jointly by the SETI Institute and the University of California, Berkeley, was purpose-built for SETI research.</p>
<p>Breakthrough Listen found no technosignature candidates. But the team did identify a Sun-like star in the signal's error box — 2MASS 19281982-2640123, roughly 1,800 light-years away — as a plausible candidate for the signal's origin. If the source was a planet orbiting that star, the signal would have been transmitted around 200 AD, during the late Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Robert Gray died in 2022, without having found the signal again. He had spent thirty-five years looking for it.</p>`,

      title: 'The Theories',
      content: `<p>Explanations accumulated like sediment. None of them settled.</p>
<p>The simplest explanation was terrestrial interference: a man-made radio signal, from the ground or from orbit, that had been picked up by Big Ear and misidentified as an astronomical source. This was always the first hypothesis tested and the first to be discarded. The frequency — 1420 megahertz — was in a band protected by international treaty, reserved exclusively for radio astronomy. No legitimate transmitter operated there. Military and commercial systems used different frequencies. Satellites broadcasting at 1420 megahertz would be violating regulations that existed specifically to prevent this kind of confusion.</p>
<p>More importantly, a terrestrial or near-Earth source would not produce the Gaussian intensity profile that the signal displayed. That smooth, symmetrical rise and fall was the signature of a distant point source passing through the telescope's beam, not of a nearby transmitter. A satellite would appear abruptly, maintain a roughly constant signal strength, and disappear abruptly. A terrestrial source would fluctuate irregularly. Neither would trace the precise bell curve that the Wow! Signal exhibited.</p>
<p>Interstellar scintillation was proposed — the idea that a weak, continuous signal from a distant natural source might have been temporarily amplified by turbulence in the interstellar medium, the way a star twinkles when its light passes through the Earth's atmosphere. It was possible in principle, but scintillation typically produces rapid fluctuations, not a single, clean, seventy-two-second peak. And it did not explain why the signal was narrowband.</p>
<p>Space debris was considered and dismissed. No known satellite or piece of orbital hardware could have produced a narrowband signal at the hydrogen frequency.</p>
<p>In 2016, a professor at St. Petersburg College in Florida named Antonio Paris proposed what became known as the comet hypothesis. Paris suggested that two comets — 266P/Christensen and 335P/Gibbs — had been in the vicinity of the Wow! Signal's coordinates in August 1977, and that the hydrogen clouds surrounding their nuclei might have produced a narrowband emission at 1420 megahertz as they outgassed under solar heating.</p>
<p>The hypothesis received considerable media attention. It was an attractive idea — a natural explanation that would close the case without requiring aliens or unknown physics. Paris claimed to have found supporting evidence in observations made with a small radio telescope in 2017, when comet 266P passed through the region of sky again.</p>
<p>The astronomical community was not impressed. Jerry Ehman himself co-authored a detailed rebuttal. The problems were numerous. Comet 266P/Christensen had not actually been in the correct position in August 1977 — it was roughly fifty-five minutes of right ascension away from the signal's coordinates, a significant angular distance. More fundamentally, no hydrogen emission from a comet's coma had ever been reliably observed at 1420 megahertz. Comets produce hydrogen through photodissociation of water, but the resulting hydrogen atoms are hot — far too energetic to emit at the narrow, precise frequency of the spin-flip transition. The physics did not work.</p>
<p>Additionally, 266P/Christensen is a quiet, low-activity comet. In August 1977, it would have been more than four astronomical units from the Sun — roughly the distance of Jupiter's orbit — and effectively dormant. The idea that it could have produced a signal thirty times above the background noise was, as one critic put it, "not consistent with any known cometary behaviour."</p>
<p>Ehman wrote: "We do not believe the two-comets theory can explain the Wow! Signal."</p>
<p>The comet hypothesis faded, but it had served a useful purpose: it demonstrated how badly people wanted an explanation, any explanation, for the signal. The discomfort of the unexplained is powerful. It drives bad science as readily as it drives good science, and the Wow! Signal had been sitting in the "unexplained" box for four decades, resisting every attempt to move it.</p>
<p>The most enduring hypothesis was also the most provocative: the signal was exactly what it looked like. It was a deliberate transmission from an extraterrestrial civilisation, broadcast at the hydrogen frequency, aimed at no one in particular or at everyone in general, detected by chance during the seventy-two seconds that Big Ear's beam happened to sweep across the source. The signal did not repeat because it was not meant to repeat — it was a beacon, or a probe signal, or a single shout into the dark, and Big Ear had caught the echo of it and nothing more.</p>
<p>This hypothesis could not be proved. It could not be disproved. It sat at the boundary of science, where evidence ends and imagination begins, and it stayed there.</p>`,

      title: 'The Demolition',
      content: `<p>Big Ear was torn down in 1998. The land on which it sat — twenty-six acres of flat, unremarkable Ohio farmland that happened to contain one of the most important radio telescopes in the history of SETI — was sold to a property developer called New Green Highlands Development Ltd. The developer wanted to build houses and expand a golf course.</p>
<p>The decision was not sudden. Ohio State University had owned the land for decades, but by the 1990s the observatory was expensive to maintain and the university's priorities had shifted. The Big Ear telescope was old technology. Its receivers were 1960s-era hardware. Its data processing system — the venerable IBM 1130 that had printed the Wow! Signal — was an antique. Newer, more powerful telescopes existed elsewhere. The university decided to sell.</p>
<p>The astronomy community protested. Robert Dixon, who had directed the Ohio SETI program for its entire twenty-four-year run, fought to save the telescope. There were petitions, letters, public campaigns. The American Astronomical Society issued a statement of concern. None of it mattered. The land was worth more as a housing development than as a scientific instrument, and in the arithmetic of university budgets, that was the end of the argument.</p>
<p>The flat reflector came down first. Then the parabolic wall. Then the ground plane — those three football fields of aluminium sheeting that had spent thirty-five years catching whispers from the cosmos. The equipment was removed or scrapped. The IBM 1130 was preserved, eventually finding its way to a museum. The site was graded, landscaped, and subdivided into 381 residential lots. The Dornoch Golf Club expanded from nine holes to eighteen.</p>
<p>Where Big Ear had once listened to the universe, people now drove golf carts and watered their lawns.</p>
<p>The demolition of Big Ear was a small tragedy, the kind that happens often and is noticed by few. Telescopes are not monuments; they are instruments, and instruments become obsolete. But there was something especially bitter about this one. Big Ear had detected the strongest candidate for an extraterrestrial signal in the history of SETI, and the world's response, two decades later, was to tear it down and build a subdivision.</p>
<p>The Wow! Signal survived the demolition as an artefact. The original printout — the one with Ehman's red circle and his handwritten "Wow!" — was preserved in the archives of the Ohio History Connection in Columbus, filed under the North American Astrophysical Observatory Records. It was a single piece of computer paper, yellowing with age, covered in columns of numbers and blank spaces, with six characters circled in red ink and one word in the margin. It was the only physical evidence that the signal had ever existed.</p>
<p>Ehman himself had been cautious from the beginning. He had never claimed that the signal was extraterrestrial in origin. "I'm convinced that the Wow! Signal certainly has the potential of being the first signal from extraterrestrial intelligence," he said in a 2019 interview, choosing his words with the care of a man who understands that scientific reputation is fragile. "No conclusion was ever possible other than it certainly had the potential." Potential. Not proof. The distinction mattered.</p>
<p>But the signal would not go away. It had become the most famous event in SETI history — more famous than Project Ozma, Frank Drake's pioneering 1960 search that had found nothing; more famous than the Arecibo message, the binary-coded greeting that had been beamed toward the M13 star cluster in 1974; more famous than any of the thousands of subsequent SETI observations that had also found nothing. The Wow! Signal was famous precisely because it was the exception. Everything else was silence. This was not.</p>
<p>It had entered popular culture — referenced in television shows, science fiction novels, podcasts, and documentaries. It had become shorthand for the question that SETI existed to answer: <em>Is anybody out there?</em> The signal did not answer the question. But it did something almost as powerful: it kept the question alive.</p>`,

      content: `<p>In August 2024, a planetary scientist named Abel Mendez published a paper that proposed, for the first time, a plausible astrophysical explanation for the Wow! Signal. Mendez, who worked at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo, had spent years analysing archival data from the Arecibo Observatory — the great 305-metre radio telescope in Puerto Rico that had itself collapsed in December 2020, another monument to the universe's indifference to human instruments.</p>
<p>Mendez's hypothesis was technical and elegant. He proposed that the signal had been produced by a hydrogen maser — a natural amplification of radio energy at the hydrogen frequency, triggered by a magnetar flare. A magnetar is a neutron star with an extraordinarily powerful magnetic field, capable of producing bursts of energy that dwarf anything else in the galaxy. If such a burst struck a cold cloud of interstellar hydrogen, the cloud could, under the right conditions, act as a natural laser — or maser, the microwave equivalent — briefly amplifying its 1420-megahertz emission by orders of magnitude and beaming it outward in a narrow, intense pulse.</p>
<p>The hypothesis was compelling because it accounted for every observed characteristic of the signal. The frequency was right — it was exactly the hydrogen line. The signal was narrowband, as a maser would be. It was strong, as a maser could be. It was transient, as a maser triggered by a one-time event would be. And it would not repeat, because the conditions that produced it — the precise alignment of magnetar, hydrogen cloud, and observer — might occur only once in centuries, or never again.</p>
<p>Mendez and his team found supporting evidence in the Arecibo archives: similar but much weaker narrowband signals near the hydrogen frequency, consistent with naturally occurring maser activity. It was not proof — proof, in science, is a word used with extreme caution — but it was the most comprehensive natural explanation anyone had proposed in forty-seven years.</p>
<p>If Mendez was right, the Wow! Signal was not a message from an alien civilisation. It was a cosmic accident — a magnetar somewhere beyond the visible stars briefly illuminating a hydrogen cloud, which briefly became a microwave beacon, which briefly shone in Big Ear's direction before fading back into the ordinary background noise of the galaxy. A natural spotlight, sweeping across the sky, caught for an instant by a telescope in Ohio.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful theory. It was also, in a way, a disappointing one. The Wow! Signal had carried, for nearly half a century, the weight of humanity's loneliest question. If it was just hydrogen — just physics, just the universe doing what the universe does — then the question was still unanswered, and the silence was still silence.</p>
<p>But that is not quite right, either. The signal's value was never really in its answer. It was in what it revealed about the people who heard it.</p>
<p>Ehman wrote "Wow!" because the data surprised him. Dixon spent twenty-four years running the longest SETI program in history because he believed the question was worth asking. Gray spent thirty-five years chasing a ghost across the radio spectrum because he could not bear to let it go. Mendez dug through the archives of a collapsed telescope because he thought the truth was in there somewhere, and because finding it mattered. These were not dreamers. They were scientists — careful, sceptical, rigorous — and they were all, in their different ways, trying to answer the same question.</p>
<p>The Wow! Signal is almost fifty years old now. The telescope that detected it is gone. The man who named it is retired. The paper it was printed on is yellowing in an archive. The patch of sky it came from is silent. But the question it asked — the question that Cocconi and Morrison asked in 1959, that Drake asked in 1960, that every SETI researcher has asked since — remains the most profound question that science is capable of posing.</p>
<p>Are we alone?</p>
<p>The signal lasted seventy-two seconds. The question has lasted forever.</p>
<p>Nobody has answered it yet. But somebody wrote "Wow!" in the margin, and that — the willingness to be astonished, the refusal to look away, the stubborn human insistence that the universe owes us an explanation — might be the most important thing of all.</p>`,
