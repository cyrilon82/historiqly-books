# HistorIQly AI Casefiles - Business Plan

*Last updated: 2026-02-01*

---

## 🚀 Launch: When Ready (April 15 deadline)

**Launch triggers (hit these = launch):**
- ✅ 1,000+ X followers
- ✅ 200+ email subscribers
- ✅ 3 free cases live & validated

**Pre-launch focus:** Build @Historiqly X account until milestones hit

## 🎯 Product Vision

**AI Casefiles** are living, evidence-based investigations into history's greatest mysteries. Unlike static ebooks, our cases are updated when new evidence emerges - making this a research platform, not just a book.

### Core Differentiator
> "Cases are updated when new evidence emerges - declassified docs, new forensic analysis, or fresh discoveries. You're not buying a book, you're subscribing to ongoing research."

## 💰 Pricing Model

### Subscription Tiers

| **Monthly** | $4.99/mo | Monthly | Cancel anytime |
| **Yearly** | $39/yr | Annual | Save 35% ($3.25/mo effective) |

- Living content justifies recurring payment

## 🚀 Release Strategy

### The "Netflix Model"
Show everything coming, release over time.

```
LAUNCH (Day 1)
├── Vol 1: 20 cases available (3 free)
├── Vols 2-10: All case titles visible as "Coming Soon"
└── Full roadmap creates FOMO

GROWTH (Months 2-24)
├── 1 new volume every ~2 months
├── Update notifications for existing cases
└── ~5 new cases per month average

MATURE (Year 3+)
├── All 200 cases released
├── Focus on updates when new evidence drops
├── "Season 2" - new volumes / expanded library
```

### Release Cadence

**Drip model:** Release individual investigations across multiple volumes (not whole volumes at once)

| Timeframe | Investigations Released |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Per week | 1-2 new cases |
| Per month | 5-6 new cases |
| Per year | ~65 cases |
| Full library | ~3 years |

**Example month:**
```
Week 1: +1 Vol 2 (Myths) + 1 Vol 5 (Conspiracies)
Week 2: +1 Vol 3 (Cold Cases)
Week 3: +1 Vol 7 (Declassified) + 1 Vol 2 (Myths)
Week 4: +1 Vol 4 (Disappearances)
```

**Why drip works better:**
- Weekly "new case" emails = constant engagement
- Multiple volumes grow simultaneously
- Subscribers see progress across topics they care about
- No long waits between volume drops
- Builds anticipation for specific cases

### Launch Content

| Content | Count | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Vol 1 complete | 20 cases | At launch |
| Free preview | 3 cases | At launch |
| Vols 2-10 | Titles only | "Coming Soon" |

*Launch with Vol 1 complete, then drip 1-2 cases/week across remaining volumes*

## 🔄 The "Living Investigation" Promise

### What Makes Us Different
Traditional ebooks are static. Our casefiles evolve.

**Update triggers:**
- New documents declassified
- Fresh forensic analysis available
- New witness testimony emerges
- Academic papers published
- Anniversaries with new retrospectives

**Subscriber notifications:**
> "🔔 Case Updated: The Hitler Diaries - New handwriting analysis from 2026 forensic study added to Evidence Map"

This justifies the subscription and creates engagement loops.
